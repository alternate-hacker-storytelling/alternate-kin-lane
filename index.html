title: About Alternate Kin Lane
overview: true
---

<p>While immersed in a world of technology, reading and writing about real-world technologies, I needed an outlet, somewhere I could publish my fictional thoughts and stories.</p>
<p>I find it easier to get back to the every day grind of tech blogging, if I have a place to produce fictional work. So I created an alternate reality where I can blog about the weird shit, I think I see every day.</p>
<p>Nothing you read at alternate.kinlane.com is real, if you are looking for my non-fiction work visit <a href="http://kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions you can email me at <a href="mailto: kinlane@gmail.com">kinlane@gmail.com</a> or tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>.</p>
