In the Internet age when you encountered sexism, class, privilege, and exploitation online, you logged off, and enjoyed the privacy of your home. With the new HN real-time API sexism, class, privilege, and exploitation can be amplified to levels to which you cannot escape. With the new real-time feed you can be sure the HN bullhorn will now be syndicated across other channels like TV, Radio, Newspaper, and the water cooler chatter at work.</p><p>The best part of today's release is that the HN community are celebrating the release as a success. Showcasing the savviness of their technological god HN, and their awareness the importance of having an API. When in reality its been years since HN first launched from the heart of Silicon Valley, and there has been no official move to launch an API. Only when an API supports the selfish needs of HN, do they consider launching an API. It wasn&rsquo;t the community that triggered the API launch, it was to continue to take the exploitation of the community, and the wider online community to the next level--amplifying the HN digital bullhorn.</p><p>Thank god technology is pure of ideology and in reality we can celebrate the release of the HN API, from one of the most celebrated vulture capital firms in the world, and the most powerful communities of tech leaders. Remember there is no denying all of this, it all moves forward because of a greater good, one that goes beyond what you want, so just accept the HN release for what it is.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
