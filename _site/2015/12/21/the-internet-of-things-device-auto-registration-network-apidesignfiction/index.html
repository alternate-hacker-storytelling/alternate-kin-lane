We all operate for different purposes. Some of us are looking to be drone or surveillance camera registries, while others are looking to provide access to weather, agricultural, or other environmental devices. The one common thread that binds us, we are all providing much needed registries for the growing number of devices that are being connected to the internet.</p><p>Depending on the industry we operate in, device registration is mandatory, or optional. While we do have manual registration solutions, which run as ready to single page applications as a service (SPAaaS), over 75% of registrations come in through auto-registration when devices are setup and activated. The popularity of auto-registration of devices in heavily regulated industries, and spawned a wave of auto-registration also being used in non-regulated industries.</p><p>Manufacturers have seen the value of IoT registries, and seen the benefit auto-registration plays when it comes establishing a much more engage device operator or consumer, but also that other 3rd opportunities available through our network of platforms. Resulting in a number of reasons why IoT device auto registration networks are working.</p><p><strong>Discovery</strong><br />As soon as a device is plugged in, it registers itself with the network of choice, seeded by the manufacturer, but ultimately the choice of the device operator. This means the device is discoverable as part of the device operators network, and the larger regulated or unregulated industry it exists within. If a device operator chooses, the device can also be discoverable by a wider ecosystem of 3rd party providers who operate via the network of directories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Security</strong><br />With all devices accounted for, the chances of devices operating with out of date software, vulnerabilities, and rogue devices from illegal manufacturers has been reduced to less than 10% of available Internet enabled devices. A registered device, has changed the IoT security discussion, and while challengers of this approach says it violates privacy, we feel it reduces the chance of exploitation, back doors, and unsecured devices operating on the open Internet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Regulation</strong><br />Auto registration has allowed government regulators to get a handle on the fastest growing spaces like drones and surveillance cameras, enabling law enforcement to levy increasingly heavier fines for unregistered devices. In 2020, devices do not come to live, and connect to the Internet without having proof of registration--giving local, state, and federal government an unprecedented window into consumer, commercial, and industrial level device usage across many industries.</p><p><strong>Accountability</strong><br />Consumer, corporate, institutional, and government device operators are held accountable as part of modern IoT device registration operations. If your drone is involved in the damage of property, or violation of privacy, you are held accountable. Device manufacturers who do not institute auto registration upon activation, have sanctions applied, not allowing them to see certain funding opportunities, or operate within specific jurisdictions.</p><p>The presence of the IoT device registration network has made the general public feel much better about the growth in popularity of Internet connected devices. It has also increased the overhead for manufacturers, and made privacy advocates more concerned about who watches the watchers, but the good brought by the network has outweighed the bad so far.</p><p>In 2021 and 2022, we are moving beyond justifying the need for IoT device registration, and addressing concerns for auto registration, and moving to more of a focus on transparency and privacy across all networks, and device operation. With all of the data we have on what IoT devices are in operation around the globe, and even in space, there is an unprecedented opportunity to help stabilize this fast growing layer of the Internet that is impacting our personal and professional lives.</p><p>If you are a device manufacturer and would like more information on registration for your device let us know. If you would like to see a registration network exist for an existing device category, please let us know--make sure you look through the forum first, and ensure work is not already in progress on such an effort.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
