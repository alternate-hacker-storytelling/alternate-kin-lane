All you need is a specific topic that is of interest to the group, then we build in as much of our proprietary capabilities as we can, to help law enforcement around the globe generate the criminal leads they need.</p><p>Our photo obfuscation as a service is an excellent example of this in action. The web site, and supporting Facebook and mobile applications, are purposely designed with a look &amp; feel that appeals to the targeted underground market. This software implementation performs one service, the taking of photos, and then we apply visual obfuscation filters to the picture.&nbsp;</p><p>As each user plays with filters, they are educated how each one will help them hide from security cameras, facial recognition, and sensor technology, making it harder for law enforcement to track them. The focus of the service is to obfuscate the way you look online, catering to the fear our target demographic experiences daily, establishing a digital honey pot for insecure criminals.</p><p>While the honey pot service will not work for all criminals, the not-so-smart ones will use the service, and as part of the apply filter portion of the process, we will keep the original photo, link to the obfuscated photo, providing a searchable media set for you to use in other law enforcement surveillance systems. Along with the photos, we provide other relevant meta data including location, camera, and any audio we capture during the session--providing as complete picture as possible.</p><p>Our historical data demonstrates &nbsp;a 75% demographic target success rate with our SaaS solutions. Our photo obfuscation as a service achieves a record 85% hot lead status, meaning 85% of those looking to obfuscate they online identity, will create a crime within the next year. For some reasons criminals still want to use their own likeness, but are also easily entertained by digital parlor tricks, as part of their overall criminal repetoire.</p><p>Take a test drive today!</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
