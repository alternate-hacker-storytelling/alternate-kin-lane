<meta name="description" content="In 2020, why would you go with any of the mainstream home security providers? The RealityCom Reality Show Surveillance Package is tailored perfectly for the modern family. We do not just keep your family safe 247/7, we also help amplify the most important aspects of your life, and share with family and friends, and even the public. Our critics call us a &quot;modern surveillance apparatus&quot;, but these people live in the past. Privacy is a concept of the last century, and the modern family has embraced being not just a consumption family, but also contributing, and participating in the best reality programming out there. The most efficient, and cost effective way to keep your family safe and sounds, is through what we call &quot;transparent living&quot;, where your home, possessions, and love ones are all monitored, and plugged into the RealityCom Security Network. When our security production staff also finds an interesting scenario, our programming staff is notified, and we take the family moment, and streamed in near real-time to the audience of your choosing. Using the transparent living technology platform, you get to share with family, friends, and when we identify it as a quality moment of programming, we will pay you for the media and content--if your family becomes viral success, we pay you exponentially more, depending on the attention your family comands. Not every family becomes a paid RealityCom Family, but you will not know if you have what it takes unless you get started with your Reality Show Surveillance Package. The best part is it is all free. We come out and install all the equipment, maintain all equipment, and store all the video, audio, and other content at no cost to you. You get modern home, auto, and work security for you and your family, for FREE! It doesn&#39;t get any better than this, sign up to day, so we can get started with your installation." />

<p>In 2020, why would you go with any of the mainstream home security providers? The RealityCom Reality Show Surveillance Package is tailored perfectly for the modern family. We do not just keep your family safe 247/7, we also help amplify the most important aspects of your life, and share with family and friends, and even the public.</p>
<p class="p1">Our critics call us a "modern surveillance apparatus", but these people live in the past. Privacy is a concept of the last century, and the modern family has embraced being not just a consumption family, but also contributing, and participating in the best reality programming out there. The most efficient, and cost effective way to keep your family safe and sounds, is through what we call "transparent living", where your home, possessions, and love ones are all monitored, and plugged into the RealityCom Security Network.</p>
<p class="p1">When our security production staff also finds an interesting scenario, our programming staff is notified, and we take the family moment, and streamed in near real-time to the audience of your choosing. Using the transparent living technology platform, you get to share with family, friends, and when we identify it as a quality moment of programming, we will pay you for the media and content--if your family becomes viral success, we pay you exponentially more, depending on the attention your family comands.</p>
<p class="p1">Not every family becomes a paid RealityCom Family, but you will not know if you have what it takes unless you get started with your Reality Show Surveillance Package. The best part is it is all free. We come out and install all the equipment, maintain all equipment, and store all the video, audio, and other content at no cost to you. You get modern home, auto, and work security for you and your family, for FREE! It doesn't get any better than this, sign up to day, so we can get started with your installation.</p>
