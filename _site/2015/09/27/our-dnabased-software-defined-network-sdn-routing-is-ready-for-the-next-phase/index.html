All modern routers, whether at the data center, or ISP level, all now have the capacity for deploying DNA SDN, something that has been in place for almost five years, but we have yet to fully realize, until now.</p><p>There was no clear path for how we could route Internet traffic based upon data, until we studied all of the traffic. At first we felt, it would take a year, but once we started analyzing, we realized we would need a larger network dataset. Really we could have done it with a 12 month dataset, but we saw DNA spoofing and other anomalies that concerned us early on, and now we are happy took the time we did.</p><p>We knew that people fake their online personas, but did not anticipate the level to which people would be able to falsify their DNA data. The second part of our early concern was around understanding&nbsp; how our partners would interpret the data, and want global Internet traffic prioritized, and routed. The motivations for falsifying your DNA, as well as prioritizing traffic proved to evolve in near real-time, something that has proven our case for the ability to push all routing decisions to the router level.</p><p>Now that we have 100% switch penetration, a deep understand around how people falsify their DNS, and what the exceptions and needs of our partners are (including the federal government), we are fully equipped for the next phase of the project. Our DNA SDN work make early concerns around net neutrality a juvenile wet dream, as we now how the control to make decisions in real time around how Internet traffic flows, not just at a technical level, but providing the true linkage between humans and the Internet via our most fundamental building block, DNA.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
