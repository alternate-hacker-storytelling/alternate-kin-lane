The houses we build for families allow them to have a living room to gather, a kitchen to cook, and dining room to enjoy dinner as a family. If we didn't' build them houses, they couldn't live as a family, and with the low subscription of $1500.00 a month for the house, we are entitled to joint ownership over the content, data, and media generated within the home.</p><p>We understand that these are the friends, relationships, photos, videos, and history of our customers, and they are included in the licensing deal, but companies like us that craft the homes, provide the kitchen, living room, and other appliances, should retain exclusive licensing across the home. It is not our intent to stand in the way of our customers, but empower them in this brave new digital world, while also acknowledging the role corporations play in home life in 2030.</p><p>The photos in question as part of this case do not deny that Jane Simpsons owns her photos, it just disputes her claim that Instagram, and our company Hohme Incorporated, are not licensed owners of this content, and are due the royalties in question. Even though Ms. Simpson is famous today, the photos were taken during her teens, using Instagram, in a Hohme Incorporated property in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>It is understood that people feels this is their content and data, but we built these homes, providing the platforms that they run their lives on, and we know the courts will understand the corporation plays an essential role in everyone's personal worlds, right alongside the individual. The home of 2030 is not the dark cave it was before the Internet, we have solved homelessness, and live in a new brighter future, where we all share the home experience.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
