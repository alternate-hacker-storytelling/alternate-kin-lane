As soon as I left the small town I was raised in, I began seeing signs that this was all just a video game extension of the small town arcade I used to blow all my quarters in at the other end of town.</p><p>I got a taste of virtual reality, programming computers in the 80's, even before the Internet was widely available--giving me some awareness that this was truly a reality show version of the game of civilization.</p><p>While I hit many speed bumps through out my early years I quickly learned i could manifest what I needed, albeit sometimes this was a good ass kicking and night spent sleeping in a ditch. The powers of manifestation isn't something they teach you in school, it is something you have to be introduced to incrementally through loving instruction and simultaneous pain, suffering and torture.</p><p>After learning I could apply Jedi mind tricks on individuals ranging from criminals to law enforcement I quickly realized I need to exercise my skills in a much more safer environment before I pushed things too far, and possibly exploded in a ball of flames.</p><p>After several years of working out in a friendly, small town work environment I thought my financial reality was a good place to test out my skills. Starting at about 30K annual income I wanted to see what I could expand this to in a mater of 5 years, ultimately taking things to 150K before I knew that I had what it would take to go the distance, but money wasn't what interested me.</p><p>Next I wanted to see if I could expand on the scope of the the world in which I was exposed to on a geographical. I wanted to be able to command things at not just a national level, but take it global and see what I could make happen. This obviously would take flexing the financial side of things, but also would take reaching a new scope of the characters I interacted with, requiring time, patience and good ol fashion relationship building.</p><p>This is where I stand. I'm able to rise to a national level, getting the attention of national leaders in government and corporations. I've successfully attracted global forces in technology and across multiple other business sectors., and now its just a matter of understanding what I can do next.</p><p>Pushing the boundaries of reality have shown me that none of this is real. It is al just a matter of understanding the appropriate game mechanics and physics at play in this reality and understand which level I'm currently on.</p><p>Let's see what I can manifest next, and where we can take all of this.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
