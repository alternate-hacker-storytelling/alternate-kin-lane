At Connected World Software we have managed to become the number one software provider in the world through a network of what we call, Quantified Developers&trade;. Our developers do not just produce code, they are code artists who live and breathe what they do and become one with the code they craft.</p><p>When we first hire people at Connected World Software, each developer is given a quantified-self wristband that will track all aspects of their life, including when they sleep, where they go, what they eat, every site they visit and application they use. After six months with the company our system will know enough about a developer to properly place them within actual business operations.</p><p>Initially developers will be tasked to write small pieces of code, that just run in lower traffic, isolated regions of our systems. It is important to not expose the code in which a developer writes, to a large surface area of our systems. Each developer will be directly connected to every line of code they produce, receiving positive or negative re-enforcment via their quantified-self wristband, in the form a an electrical signal.</p><p>Every time a developers code is run, they will receive a soothing electrical signal that makes them aware of their impact across the network. However anytime an error is encountered in their code, they will receive an electrical signal, but much sharper and direct than other positive signals. If a developer is given too many lines of code, without properly assessing their error rate level or even tolerance for being connected to their code, employment will usually end abruptly.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/fiction/connected-world-software/quantified-self-bracelet.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p><p>Most developers quickly adjust to both elevate run rates on their code, as well as adapt to any errors--quickly learning, adapting and reducing the number of mistakes, producing the best quality code possible. Those who do not, quickly leave the company and move on. No developer wants to be directly connected to badly written code, and positive signals quickly become a reward systems, that when a developer gets more lines of production code under their belt, can prove to be a real-time incentive and even act as a stimulant. Developers rapidly learn to write code that produces the best possible system and network effects, looking to increase their surface area and receive a more constant, elevated signal.</p><p>When a developer is directly connected with the code they craft, living every day, feeling and understanding the value their code generates in the world, it makes for the best possible developer you can find. Developers become quantified themselves, but their place within systems and across the network become quantified as well. This process, over a 3-5 year time frame, produces not just quality software, but developers who have been show to never leave their job and are 100% committed to their careers.</p><p>At Connected World Software, we won't just build systems for you, that will drive the next generation of your business--our developers will embed themselves, their lives and passion, making sure your business runs as efficiently as possible. Don't just hire developers, quantify your developers, allowing them to become one with your systems and operations.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
