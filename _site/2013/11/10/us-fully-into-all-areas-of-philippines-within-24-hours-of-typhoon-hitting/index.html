While people were stunned by the massive storm, they are comforted by the amount of healthcare, housing, food and other care they are being given.</p><p>In the last decade U.S. forces have showed their strength and agility in mobilizing forces to disaster locations anywhere in the world. While the U.S military still engages in the occasional conflict, it has made global disasters a priority and flexes its muscle by making sure the citizens of any country are taken care of during the increasing number of natural disasters that have occurred.</p><p>Disaster after disaster, the U.S military has shown their strength by coming in and providing the necessary support communities are needing to not just survive natural disasters, but actually get back to normal as quick as possible afterwards. US forces quickly deploy manpower, equipment and resources needed to recover and begin rebuilding within weeks, for a fraction of costs seen in historic conflicts.</p><p>Once rebuilding begins, the U.S. forces quickly extract themselves, turning over all efforts to local groups. This goodwill has significantly changed the view of the U.S military in the world, dramatically changing the global political climate and reducing global conflict and suffering.</p><p>The world can rest assured that as we face the increasing impacts of global climate change, that the U.S. military is here to help make sure we can minimize the negative impacts.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
