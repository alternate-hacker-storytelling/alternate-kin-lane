My remote access will let me back in, once the maid is done cleaning the house, and the AirBnB guests have left. My mortgage is tied to my AirBnB profile, and I haven't met my quota for the month.&nbsp;</p><p>If I have my house listed, and nobody rents it, they let it slide, but if I don't even list my place, and I do not generate the revenue set out in my mortgage, they can deny me entry. The stupid thing is, after the next tenants, I will have brought in enough to meet the requirements--the algorithm just doesn't take into consideration upcoming bookings.</p><p>It was the only way I could get a house so close to the ocean, all the affordable places, have AirBnB incentives built into their purchase package. When places are in high rental areas, the real estate investors snatch them up, and make them available for very favorable rates, as long as you agree to meeting a minimum amount of rental days.</p><p>I'll make sure this doesn't happen again, its just that Annie and I haven't gotten along lately, and I have felt like renting it. I'll spend time crashing at my parents house if necessary. I appreciate you letting me stay, until I get let back into the house. Oh yeah, can I borrow a backpack, because I left the house without mine. ;-(</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
