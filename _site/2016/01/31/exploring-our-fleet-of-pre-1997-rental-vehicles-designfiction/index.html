<meta name="description" content="Its no secret that every automobile manufactured today has built in tracking, with newer vehicles employing real time tracking via 4G networks. However vehicles manufactured after 1997 also possess central computers, which can be used to easily gathered, and transmit the details of all operations of a vehicle, including its location.&nbsp; This is why we have maintained a massive fleet of quality, pre 1997 automobiles, and offer them up for you to rent in over 180 cities around North America. All of our vehicles DO NOT HAVE centralized computers, with an emphasis on investing in vehicles with the least amount of computer technology possible.&nbsp; Our fleet of &quot;dumb&quot; vehicles range from classic 1950s cars, to 1980 Volkswagen Vanagons, and everything in between. Some vehicles are designed for local commutes, with others designed for long distance travel, and even Volkswagen vans for your summer trip to the Grand Canyon, or even your favorite music festival. We can help you find exactly the vehicle you need, for whatever purposes We&#39;ve recently received a lot of negative press lately that we are the rental car company for drug dealers--this is not the case. Sure we have the occasional customer who is renting from us to avoid detection in their illegal activities, but the majority of our customers are just looking to escape the clutches of technology as much as they possibly can, freeing themselves from some of the surveillance that is ubiquitous in our lives. You can visit our website at dumb.cars to find the location nearest to you. Browse our vehicle fleet online, and find the one that best matches your needs. Alternatively, if you are the owner of a quality pre 1997 automobile, and would like to see it live on in our fleet, give us a call, and there is a good chance well buy it from you, and we even have revenue share opportunities when your vehicle joining our fleet." />

<p>Its no secret that every automobile manufactured today has built in tracking, with newer vehicles employing real time tracking via 4G networks. However vehicles manufactured after 1997 also possess central computers, which can be used to easily gathered, and transmit the details of all operations of a vehicle, including its location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why we have maintained a massive fleet of quality, pre 1997 automobiles, and offer them up for you to rent in over 180 cities around North America. All of our vehicles DO NOT HAVE centralized computers, with an emphasis on investing in vehicles with the least amount of computer technology possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our fleet of "dumb" vehicles range from classic 1950s cars, to 1980 Volkswagen Vanagons, and everything in between. Some vehicles are designed for local commutes, with others designed for long distance travel, and even Volkswagen vans for your summer trip to the Grand Canyon, or even your favorite music festival. We can help you find exactly the vehicle you need, for whatever purposes</p>
<p>We've recently received a lot of negative press lately that we are the rental car company for drug dealers--this is not the case. Sure we have the occasional customer who is renting from us to avoid detection in their illegal activities, but the majority of our customers are just looking to escape the clutches of technology as much as they possibly can, freeing themselves from some of the surveillance that is ubiquitous in our lives.</p>
<p>You can visit our website at dumb.cars to find the location nearest to you. Browse our vehicle fleet online, and find the one that best matches your needs. Alternatively, if you are the owner of a quality pre 1997 automobile, and would like to see it live on in our fleet, give us a call, and there is a good chance well buy it from you, and we even have revenue share opportunities when your vehicle joining our fleet.</p>
