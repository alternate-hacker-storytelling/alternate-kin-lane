In 2026, it has become very clear that humans are to blame for the volatile environment we all have to live in, something that would be unimaginable even five years ago. We really don't want to be in the business of "I Told You So!", but with limited resources, we have to begin limiting those who actually receive government resources in this time of need.</p><p>Using NSA records, we have a complete record of social media, news, television, and other media outlets, and we have been able to develop very successful algorithms for identifying climate change deniers. While NOBODY would be caught publicly speaking out against climate change in 2026, with all the death, devastation, and suffering we've all witnessed, but just a few short years ago there were many. At first we were hesitant to apply this historical record, but with the shortages we face, we had to find a solution.</p><p>In short, if you were publicly denying the humans impact on the climate between the years 2000 to present, you are on this list. You will not be given any access to public resources, to help you in your time of need. We are sorry, but we have all been through this together, and you made a conscious choice to not only work to do anything to reverse the negative impact of humans on earth, you actively fought back to limit what the rest of us could do. As a society, we should not have been spending time arguing whether or not humans were responsible for climate change, it should have been all hands n deck, for the last 25 years minimizing the impact humans are making on the earth.</p><p>We are very sorry for the impact this decision has on your life, and those of your family. We suggest that you go to your church, and look for a place to sleep, and food to eat. The rest of the citizens of this country, who have been doing their best to work as a collective, acknowledging we are all in this together, will be first in line for loans to rebuild their homes, businesses, and have access to government run food banks, clothing shops, and rehabilitation centers.</p><p>We will be reassessing this decision on an annual basis, to better understand what resources we have available.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
