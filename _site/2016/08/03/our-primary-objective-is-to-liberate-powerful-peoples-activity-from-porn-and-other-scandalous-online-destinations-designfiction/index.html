Porn and hookup type websites just aren&#39;t going to prioritize security like banks, and other companies will. We do not care about 98% of the profiles and activities we come across, but after we run through our graph database analyzer, there is usually about 2% of the users we will add to the database. We are just looking for powerful people who are leaders in companies and governments of any shape or size. Our graph database keeps track of important people, their family, wives, girlfriends, and any other possible doorway to their online worlds. It only takes one message, one photo or video, from the right person, and we can pwn a potentially powerful person&#39;s&nbsp;digital self.&nbsp; If they are a city council person they might only be worth a couple grand. If they work for a big corporation they might be worth a couple hundred grand. If they work in just the right government agency, they could be worth millions. Usually, the more they are worth, the more cautious they are online, except for the power variable--where the more powerful they are the more likely they are to do really stupid shit online that they think is secret. Our graph database keeps track of all the people, their profiles, and their relationships--our predictive analytics drives the potential value ranking of each profile, often driving where we investment our time and resources. About 50% of our time is spent on infiltrating general targets, where the other 50% is spent on specific platforms where high-value targets are known to be frequenting--these can be harder to get into. With the amount of time spent online by the average person, the odds are increasingly in our favor, all we have to do is keep mining. Of course, if you have any specific targets you&#39;d like to see included, along with any specifics on their online activity we&#39;d like to talk." />

<p>We are just looking for powerful people who are leaders in companies and governments of any shape or size. Our graph database keeps track of important people, their family, wives, girlfriends, and any other possible doorway to their online worlds.

<p>If they are a city council person they might only be worth a couple grand. If they work for a big corporation they might be worth a couple hundred grand. If they work in just the right government agency, they could be worth millions. Usually, the more they are worth, the more cautious they are online, except for the power variable--where the more powerful they are the more likely they are to do really stupid shit online that they think is secret.</p>
<p>Our graph database keeps track of all the people, their profiles, and their relationships--our predictive analytics drives the potential value ranking of each profile, often driving where we investment our time and resources. About 50% of our time is spent on infiltrating general targets, where the other 50% is spent on specific platforms where high-value targets are known to be frequenting--these can be harder to get into.</p>
<p>With the amount of time spent online by the average person, the odds are increasingly in our favor, all we have to do is keep mining. Of course, if you have any specific targets you'd like to see included, along with any specifics on their online activity we'd like to talk.</p>
