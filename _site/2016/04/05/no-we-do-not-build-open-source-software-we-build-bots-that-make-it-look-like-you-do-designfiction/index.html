One of these signals is showing that your company supports the concept of open source software. To get government contracts these days, you often have to provide open source software possibilities -- even if your core offering is proprietary, or operates in the cloud.</p><p>It is always cool to do open source, but sadly it is also something that isn't in the DNA of every company. Without an existing team, most companies are faced with the costly challenge of assembling the right team to deliver an open source offering. This is where we come in, and our fully automated, open source software community bot, where you set your spend, and we take care of everything else.</p><p>Our bots will slowly build the software, write blog posts, submit bug tickets, an manage community forums. We do not really build open source software solutions, we provide a bot army that will put on the show of an open source community, within your domain. Most of your customers will never venture into the open source side of your operations, but for those that do, we can put on a good show. To the moderately engaged individual, your open source software community will send all the right signals. There will be commits, conversations, pseudo implementations, and even active Twitter conversations, followers and much, much more.</p><p>Our Open Source Software Community Bots&trade; will take care of all the heavy lifting for your company. If you sign up for a 3 year contract today, we throw in a free OSS Haterz&trade; add-on package, helping you deal with the inevitable fact that haters are gonna hate. Remember, you have a 3-5 year window to make the impact that you will need, and achieve the numbers required to achieve the exit you are looking for. Make sure you are sending the right signals, and using the latest bot-enabled tech.</p></div></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="footer__container"><ul class="footer__social"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kinlane" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src="http://alternate.kinlane.com/assets/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
