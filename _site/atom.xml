    <content><![CDATA[Like most Internet technologies, APIs began as something intended to help augment us humans, but over time they became something that changed, altered, and forever doomed us as human beings through a million digital cuts to our uniquely human soul. Originally known as application programming interfaces back at the beginning of the century, the technical description was shortened to simply API, but along the way APIs were weaponized to not just augment us, but consume us, and reduce every aspect of our existence to a transaction. This weaponization of APIs has been called by many researchers as sentinelization of APIs, turning what used to be common business workflows and automation into an assault on humanity that has never been witnessed before. A common set of API workflows often began as simple automation for your life, but over time would intelligently shape and control your life. Initially APIs required human feedback loops and manual adjustments to evolve, but with the introduction of machine learning models, APIs began to adapt in real-time. APIs went from allowing you to integrate and automate around the calendar you had planned for the week to dictating your calendar and not allowing any deviation from it, integrating your daily schedule into any relevant system the API platform desired. Over the course of 25 years at the early part of this century, APIs went from augmented enablement to digital puppet strings that would control our every moves, tearing apart families, lives, and communities along the way. In one century, we went from using a handful of APIs to communicate and buy products online, to millions of APIs literally shaping every single moment of every single day. As enterprises learned that they could nudge us digitally via our Internet connected devices, they began to view the digital experiences they were creating as about shaping the behavior of not just their customers, but collectively entire industries and nations. Bit by bit, and transaction by transaction, we handed over our day, and eventually our lives, to just a handful of corporations who were colluding to shape the world as they saw it. APIs became the mechanism in which corporations would assert control over society, through the sentinelization of what began as simple digital resources like images, videos, and messages. With each terms of service we agreed to, and application we installed on our phone, television, and automobile, we would eventually sell our souls into a digital prison we are now calling the singularity. We are far from understanding what has happened. We are even further from knowing how to remove APIs from our world. There are many people who are not interested in pushing back against the millions of APIs that have emerged around us in our physical world. Sentinel APIs have been designed to not just resist an attack, but aggressively seek out any threat. If you are reading this, it is likely via a physically printed copy, but if you are reading online, please understand-—you are now in danger....]]></content>

    <title>I Am Responsible For This Messed Up Timeline We Find Ourselves In</title>

    <content><![CDATA[I now remember the evening that set all of this in motion. When the fracture in the space time continuum occurred. From my position this is when I started down this timeline, but guess y’all are along for the ride as well. Chad, Toby, Ramon and I had decided to eat some acid. It was some fresh album cover acid Chad and Toby had gotten from their cousins. We ripped it up into four separate chunks and each began chewing on our wad of paper. We had mostly forgotten that we ate it once it started kicking in. The right mixture of time and bong hits passed and we slipped into this new timeline barely noticing the world had shifted around us. Within 15 minutes Ramon was asleep as he always was. He would come around the next day claiming that it was some bunk shit as he always did. Toby began talking about this hot chick he had met at a party last night, and slipped away into the night, hunting down the pretty girl as Toby always did. Chad sat in the corner plucking away at his guitar trying to emulate Eddie Van Halen, stating his desire to be a rock guitar god like Eddie, because then he could live forever, drinking as much Jack Daniels, and smoking as many cigarettes as he wanted. Closing his thoughts with a couple well crafted smoke rings before attempting Eruption for the 20th time. Chad would fade into the background as I mistakenly turned on the television and entered into my new heighten state of awareness, and unknowingly was given the keys to the future, letting a kid who possessed amazingly powerful abilities to manifest reality, but who had next to no experience doing it, get in behind the wheel of this clown car we call humanity. From my fearful position in Southern Oregon in 1988 I was exhausted from the Ronald Reagan brand of conservatism I was drowning in, with his wife literally starting a war in our backyard, sending in the Black Hawk helicopters each summer to route up my friends parents who were growing Marijuana. After making my way back along the river from Chad and Toby’s moms house, upstream to Bobby’s house we all gave the middle figure to a helicopter making its way up the river—-close enough that I could see the eyes of the men leaning out the window like they were in Nam. When I turned on the television that evening, David Letterman had just started, and just as he invited on Donald Trump I began to lose grip with reality. I can’t tell you want he said. I can’t articulate what the next 6 hours contained. It is just a jumbled vortex of images of Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, war, power, hatred, racism, and white supremacy. Now, in 2020 I can see this vortex forming a swirling mess of what we consider reality today. I can see Trumps lips moving then, and them...]]></content>

    <title>The Facial Recognition Network Has Exposed That There Are Only So Many Souls to Go Around</title>

    <content><![CDATA[At about 60% global coverage for facial recognition network is where we began to suspect there was something else going on. However, it was until about 90% global coverage were we able to verify that some people are in fact the same people, cloned souls, or however you want to put it. It began with an increase in the number of mistaken identity cases, and then it became visible at scale once there was a global incarceration network, and we began sending facial recognition matches to the same facility. At first the system didn’t notice anything was wrong. The cameras would capture the video, the facial recognition software would identify the faces, the police would pick them up, and the global routing mechanism would route them to a specific location based upon their crime(s). It was when we started shipping everyone to the same location, after the global crime treaties were enforced, and we started globally arresting people based upon facial recognition as well as centrally shipping them based upon artificial intelligence pattern mapping we realized we were arresting essentially the same person over and over around the globe. We then began to ship the same person to the same location, resulting in sometimes upwards of 12 or 15 individuals who were essentially the exact same individual-—with just a few minor differences based upon where they were born and the environment they grew up in. Honestly, we aren’t quite sure what to do with this information. If someone commits a crime, or is targeted for potentially committing a crime in accordance with some of the new predictive algorithms, should that information be used to bring in their duplicates? Are they the same person? They look and act the same. They often have the same fingerprints and other biometric data. There are studies being conducted on the first couple of waves of individuals who have come in to better understand what is going on. We don’t want to consider this a mistake if for some reason each of the clones have the potential to also commit crimes. We definitely don’t want a massive public relations nightmare regarding the usefulness of global facial recognition systems—we just got everything installed and working properly after years of challenges. For now, we’ll just keep this under wraps, continue processing people, and we will decide what we’ll do down the road when we know more. It really is kind of creepy when you go to one of the detention facilities. A bunch of clones are just crammed into the same room. The system doesn’t recognize them as separate entities, so there isn’t additional resources provided to house and feed them–we have to put them all in the same place for now. There is an additional concern also emerging within these environments, as the individuals seem to be getting to know each other very well, and seem to be developing a very strong bond. Resulting in some pretty disturbing gang like behavior with some of the groups....]]></content>

    <title>I Caught Myself Flickering in the Mirror Late Thursday Night</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/06/20/i-caught-myself-flickering-in-the-mirror-late-thursday-night/"/>

    <content><![CDATA[I spend a lot of time working late. 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM is prime coding time. Even after working a 10 hour day at my job, I am usually working 4-6 hours late into the night on any one of my side projects. Last week my girlfriend had bought a new mirror and put it by the bathroom door in our bedroom, perfectly placed to reflect myself back to me as a sat at my bedroom office desk. I regularly noticed myself out of the corner of my eye, but I hadn’t really given the mirror much thought. A couple of times I would stop and acknowledge how old and fat I am getting, but it was late into the night this last Thursday, as I approached 3:00 AM and was just about to hit save on some fresh code, I noticed a faint flicker in the mirror. I skipped a beat. My reflection had flickered, like the mirror was a television.

It freaked me out so much I moved the mirror. I think I slept an hour that night. I am guessing it was my eyes playing tricks on me after staying up so long staring at the screen. Or maybe it was the pot I smoked earlier that night. I’ve heard of people lacing weed. That would explain why it seemed so real to me. I could feel it. I could feel the flickering throughout my body, and in my head. It is like I have spent so much time online performing as a digital version of myself, that my digital self began flipping switches to turn on and off my physical self, instead of the other way around. I was still present, but the old physical representation of myself wasn’t carrying as much weight as it normally does. I felt like had given so much power to the online version of myself, that my physical body almost didn’t matter-—except that it does!

My girlfriend ended up moving the mirror into the bathroom, so it isn’t a problem anymore. I am a little afraid to see if the flickering is still happening. Since then I have experienced five more times where I felt the same way as I did that night, wrapping up marathon coding sessions, or just spending way too much time online watching videos, chatting, and scrolling through meaningless digital garbage. I feel it in my head first. A sort of digital migraine, where the gears start skipping a beat, and my brain feels like it’s getting electrical pulses from a long fried circuit board still trying to accomplish its binary tasks. I’m too afraid to put the mirror back in place and confirm my worst fears—-that I have spent so much time online that my physical self barely even matters anymore in this digital prison I have built for myself online.

    <title>Autocompleting The Meaning Behind My Messages</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2020/02/29/autocompleting-the-meaning-behind-my-messages/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-29T09:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[It was my teenage daughter and her cousin who first brought it to my attention. She was texting to him on the couch, and then looked over his shoulder to read what she had just sent to him. She exclaimed, “that is not what I said!” Then she looked at her phone and in fact it was what she had written. I asked her how the message was different. She said it was mostly what she had written, but had one or two words that were different. I dismissed it as an autocorrect error-—it happens to us all. She dismissed my diagnosis and remained confident that there was something malicious going on, and she would get to the bottom of it. I didn’t give it much more thought until a couple of weeks later when I had something similar occur to me at work. I had messaged a co-worker asking them to shift their position on a project proposal, asking them to be more in alignment with our union position, but after the proposal was submitted, they clearly had gone the other direction. I asked them why they didn’t listen to what I said, and they said they had. I checked my messages, and sure enough I had. Why would I do that? I distinctly remember taking a stance that was in alignment with our union objectives. After this occurring a handful of other times I began writing down what I said to anyone over text message or online chat. I began to keep a detailed diary of what I said to anyone online, and sure enough I began noticing that my messages were changing over time. I would type in one thing, and the message would arrive to sender transformed, and then it would also shift on my own device. My messaging software was not just auto-correcting my words, it was autocorrecting the meaning of what I was saying via my mobile phone and laptop computer. After six months I have identified 368 separate situations where the meaning and context of what I was saying slightly shifted, which most of the time did not have much of an impact, but as with the original project proposal where I first noticed all of this, some had profound effects on my personal and professional life. 76% of these shifts occurred on mew workplace devices, with the rest occurring on my personal devices. In a work environment the shifts always seemed to be in alignment with the direction of the company I work for. In the home environment I couldn’t see enough patterns to understand where the shifts in meaning might be driven. Clearly leadership at my company had some had in shaping the algorithms that transformed my messages in a workplace context, but who was doing it in my personal life? Government? Corporations? I just can’t tell who the puppet master might be in my personal world. I would have to keep logging these subtle shifts in how I communicate, and...]]></content>

    <title>Stirring Up Some Business Down There</title>

    <content><![CDATA[No baby. I’m just the carrier, but every time I do the pick up, I do end up having to spend a whole afternoon with the blowhard. Telling me how much money they are raking in operating the border camps, and all you have to do is leak a story to the press about how crowded things, and you can ask for more money to increase capacity. This administrations stance on immigration has been a huge boost to the private detention center industry, but more importantly the underground market which I’m cashing in on. It is my job to just make sure the payments to stir the pot down south are distributed to the four separate gangs who do the work riling everyone up. At least today we ate at a decent restaurant. He must really be doing well, cause I know what a tight wad he is. He’s also happens to be my uncle, so I’ve known him a while. Anyways, I’ll be taking about $620K south this time, distributing it equally amongst the gangs. They get to decide what they want to do, and as along as we seem some ROI, there will be another payment next month. I’m guessing these guys would do it for free, but they see an opportunity for making a buck, while also cultivating a get out of jail free card when it comes to business they do within the United States. My role is simple. I make 25K per drop — not a bad take for days worth of work. My uncle works for SafeRefuge, who has approximately 37% of the migrant detention center business—a share that has grown 280% this year alone. He’s a nobody really, but that is what makes him a useful idiot, and I guess I am too, by association. I don’t give a shit. It is cold hard cash. All I gotta do is get the money to Ciudad de Guatemala and the gangs do the rest. They meet me at the same hotel each time, I split the cash four ways, and then we fucking party! It is always a completely out of control time, which I barely remember. Leaving me thankful I never bring more than 1K with me, because I always wake up broke as shit. It is worth it. I don’t know how long this business will keep up. Regardless, I’m guessing it will keep going through at least 2020, and I’m sure it will take longer to stop the train one it has been going for a couple of years. The amount of infrastructure already in place, and the amount of money flowing, it won’t be something you can stop overnight. However it plays out, I’m guessing I’ll walk away with just shy of 1M in cash. Do I feel guilty? Hell no! This is America dammit, if you can get away with locking people up, and getting paid for it—do it!! Just don’t be stupid enough to get locked up, and...]]></content>

    <title>We Outsource All Of Our Defect Development</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2019/07/23/we-outsuorce-all-of-our-defect-development/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-23T09:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[We have 3rd party development shops that deliver our defective solutions. When we identify an opportunity for “accidentally” grabbing audio, video, or other data, we make sure a 3rd party development shop has their finger prints all over it. There are plenty of web, mobile, device, and network development shops out there who are hungry for contracts, which are also easily infiltrated by seemingly low-level staff ho can assist us in ensuring that the defects we are looking for exist within software. Of course our terms of service state that we will not record what you are saying in your home with our devices. However, this does not mean that data will not accidentally be recorded, uploaded to the cloud, and remain as part of the operation of devices in which are not patched. We count on the fact that it will take months, if not years for some bugs to be found, and we depend on the fact that many users will not ever patch their devices even after the update is made available. Making defect development the optimal way to ensure that we can still capture the audio, pictures, images, and other data we need to properly connect the dots at the highest level. Once a defect has been discovered and we are forced to fix it, all we need to do is provide an update, as soon as we possibly can. As we said, the update may never be applied, but we can also delay, slow, and sometimes even prevent the update from ever happening. Even if we do get in trouble with regulatory agencies when it comes to a defect, we can always shift the blame to the 3rd party development shop. Outsourcing the responsibility to another company, citing our terms of service and other legalese to help defend our practices. Development shops are a dime a dozen, and we can also seed the establishment of them through lucrative partnership deals, driving willing partners towards the opportunity of upcoming contracts—making for one of the most lucrative ways in which we can outsource defect development and liability. Software defects are critical to achieving our business objectives. Without them we cannot obtain the amount of data we need to achieve the scale required to compete with the handful of other companies who lead the pack. Accidentally audio, photos, video and other data accounts for over 70% of the data we use in our predictive models. Defect data only remains on-premise until these models are developed, then we overwrite with the latest batch—until we are caught. All data is removed once regulators catch on, and we usually only have about 60-90 days worth whenever this situation occurs. Allowing us to keep our vital data assets absorbed into our black box, proprietary, machine learning models. Defect development is handled by just a handful of executives, and a few trusted partners. This outsource development work is handled by our project managers, but as far as they are concerned, we are getting...]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[Not everyone has the guts to be honest about what the future will hold. Not everyone in this country has a bright future, and some are better off burning out instead of facing the dark future that is in store for them. The individuals who are attracted to drugs at this moment in time are the same individuals who will cost society money down the road when it comes to prison, healthcare, other services. Preemptive, phased in, slow build executions are the most logical, and efficient way to deal with the growing cost of non-compliant citizens. It is cheaper to produce Fentanyl, sell it on the underground, and address the underbelly of our society, than it is to clean up the aftermath and realize the full cost of these individuals life-long burden to our society. We consider ourselves the honorable, early stage executioners carrying out what society only will always put off. Doing the hard work to truly make our country a better place. Unfortunately, the country still views what we do as illegal, and immoral, forcing us to operate in the shadows. However, we feel strongly that we will be viewed as heroes when the time is right, after we’ve successfully cured our world of the illness and weakness that exists at the moment. Some states have experimented with Fentanyl as a execution drug, demonstrating that we are just ahead of our time. By putting Fentanyl on the black market, we are only using the darker organic forces that already exist in our world to expedite the arrest, incarceration, trial, and costly execution process. Not to mention the high cost society has to bear as this illness winds its way through our society. People who live within these shadowy black markets of our society are ill, and they will only continue to grow sicker. We are only expediting the pace of the illness, while alleviating the pain of these individuals, and relieving the burden their families carry. Organic, localized, self-induced, and preemptive executions reflect what will still happen in the future, but is something that allows us to be more honest about this reality in the present. This type of honesty is hard to come by in today’s landscape. However, within 2-3 generations the results of this honesty will become evident. We’ve done the math on how many cycles we will need to eliminate this illness from our society, based upon our 2010-2020 trial period. The results of our organic distribution, and preemptive executions of some of the most troubled among us has exceeded our expectations. We’ve achieve 300% of our target goals, within almost 95% accuracy when it came to the geographic and class demographics identified in our research. We are going to scale up our efforts over the next decade, reaching all 50 states, and by 2030 we hope to have achieved 60% of our objective, and by 2040 we should have properly cleansed society, leaving only the strongest and healthiest citizens–forever changing the makeup of this...]]></content>

    <title>Marty McFly Syndrome Hits 60% Of The Population</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/07/22/marty-mcfly-syndrome-hits-60-percent-of-the-population/"/>
    <updated>2018-07-22T09:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[We never quite fully understood our physical self before we set out defining our digital self. There appears to be a lot more to our physical self than what we knew, and with 60% of the population suffering from what has been dubbed, “Marty McFly Syndrome”, we are unsure if we will ever actually fully be able to reverse the clock. The syndrome has nothing to do with time travel, or changing the course of time (maybe), it has more do with the role that being seen by others plays into the physical definition of who we truly are. In 2024, most people work from home. Retail has been almost completely eliminated, and home delivery is the norm. Beginning in 2023, people began flickering. Physically flickering. Those who experienced these symptoms soon began disappearing. Not a lot. Just a little. A faint translucence and flickering after about a year of progression. Researchers quickly associated this illness with staying at home too much. Many of the people suffering from the condition had not left home for weeks, months, and some refused to go outside at all, having been behind closed doors for over 5 years. Apparently there is more to the self than just what you see, it also matters what others see. In the last few months the Internet has been been calling this condition, “Marty McFly Syndrome”, just as scientists begin to finally get a handle on this Internet induced illness. One thing researchers noticed is that people who lived within large urban centers that possessed package delivery elevators in their building suffered most from this syndrome. They never had to see anyone. Where people who accepted face to face deliveries, as well as the delivery people themselves never contracted the syndrome. Leaving scientists concluding that the condition is due to limited physical contact with other people, or more specifically, not being seen by other people. A kind of, if you aren’t seen by others, you can’t been seen by others. If that makes any sense? Apparently we underestimated the importance of being seen in public spaces. At stores, in parks, and in-person at our places of employment. By 2020, the population began working mostly from home, and as retail stores went online or out of business, and parks were developed into condominiums, people stopped going outside. There was no reason to leave your house. Showing that you have to be seen, to be seen. If nobody sees you, you do not matter. Your physical image in your community matters to your actual physical self existing. Now, we don’t fully understand the extent of this syndrome, and whether a human ceases to exist completely if they disappear physically, but more tests are being conducted to understand the extent of the condition. There are numerous patients who have refused to go outside at all, and are actually planning on disappearing—-further tests will be conducted within these limited populations. There is kind of an “I Told You So” attitude amongst those...]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[It has been one month since Elon Musk vowed to go into Flint, Michigan and solve the water crisis once and for all. The tech billionaire said he had enough when it came to the community not having access to clean water. The city’s water criss first started in 2014 when the drinking water source for the city was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the cheaper Flint River–due to insufficient water treatment, lead leached from the lead water pipes into the drinking water, exposing over 100,000 residents. After four years of inaction at all levels of government Elon Musk vowed to fix the problem once and for all. Sure enough, after exactly a month, the city’s water system has been rebuilt from the source to all the water mains, leaving only the last mile of delivery to be replaced now. Musk put his own money on the line, but within two weeks he had hundreds of other tech millionaires putting in their money on the table to help make sure there was enough money to get the job done properly. All of the money was donated, with nobody asking for any guarantees to be paid back, making sure the struggling city wouldn’t face challenges down the road when it came to recovering from the crisis. There will still need to be an approximate 1.3 billion to replace the last mile of water pipes into the aging community’s houses, something everyone is hoping will be raised in coming months. The Flint crisis is the first one where Elon Musk has not just put his reputation and money on the line, but he also showed up personally to lead the effort. Staying onsite for the entire month, leading teams, demonstrating that he is more than talk when it comes to jumping on the bandwagon around these disasters. It was unclear whether or not he actually helped Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, but after showing up and fixing the problem in Flint, it is clear that Musk means business. Leading by example, and showing that the wealthy tech community truly can come together to make change in some of the poorest communities in our country. Something that people are hoping will become a trend, and encouraging the tech community to begin solving some of the most challenging problems we all face in the United States. People are already talking about what grand challenge might be next for Musk. Will it be getting Puerto Rico back on its feet? Helping fix the transportation system in New York City? The opiate epidemic? Who knows? With their new found confidence in the tech community, people are hoping the tech elite will begin taking ownership of real world problems in this country, instead of pretending to fix made up problems, and build applications that help the already well off. While many people feel that technology can’t solve all of our problems, it is pretty clear that the tech elite can make a difference...]]></content>

    <title>The New Corporate Hustle Algorithm</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2018/07/08/the-new-corporate-hustle-algorithm/"/>
    <updated>2018-07-08T09:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[Dan from IT has released a new version of the corporate hustle application, with a whole new algorithm directing our spontaneous activity throughout the day. This is version 3.0 of the application after our company adopted the Density system across all corporate locations. Pushing back on management putting Density units in every room, hallway, stairwell, and lobby across all 10 of our buildings, tracking the activity and density that exists across our company. Taking advantage of the Density API, Dan’s team began sending out push notifications to everyone in the company, providing choreography for our activity throughout the day. We’ve all downloaded a mobile application they developed which provides us with real time direction, as well as a music playlist we can tune into if we so choose. If any room in any of our buildings is going unused, the application will make sure someone heads down there to occupy the space, sending the right signals to Density, which then provides the needed signals to the management dashboard, letting them know the space is being used. If the hallways are suddenly too empty, half the meeting will be directed to dance down the hallway, around the floor, and back to the meeting, where the other half will do the same in the reverse direction. The alcove at the top of the stairs breaks out in dance-offs at least 20 times day to make sure there is activity at regular intervals. Any empty office gets a occupant working in rotation every 23.5 minutes according to the new algorithm. Just to mess with management we all shift from one side of the building to the other three times a day. The routines and soundtracks have become so well done that nobody questions what is going on anymore, you just do what you are told, and let the music play. The first rule of hustle club is nobody acts like they know anything when asked by management regarding what is going on. Several employees were asked this week about what seemed like a conga line around the 5th floor last Friday, where everyone managed to keep a straight face, and acted bewildered throughout the interrogation.&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; The objective with the hustle algorithm is to keep management on their toes, disrupt this new investment in corporate surveillance gear, and most importantly, have fun each and every day. Fuck the man, and their desire to surveil and track on everything–we are damn sure, who will have the last word on this subject. You want to make sure space is used efficiently, we’ll make sure every square inch is efficiently put to use on a regular basis. The best feature of version 3.0 of the application is the ability for anyone in the club to choreograph their own spontaneous activity and music playlist. Some team members are getting pretty good at coming up with creative uses of every space within the company, they’ve adopted entirely new roles within the company. Some of the heat map images have...]]></content>

    <title>Seven Years Of Dispatches From Front Lines Of The API Description Wars</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/30/seven-years-of-dispatches-from-front-lines-of-api-description-wars/"/>

    <content><![CDATA[APIs are how cyber warfare is waged. APIs are how business, government, institutions, and individuals are being targeted, infiltrated, and indoctrinated as part of the millions of cyber war skirmishes occurring around the globe in 2017. These are some of my stories from the last seven years on the front lines of this war, documenting how these cyber militias are planning, mapping out, communicating, and executing their attacks in this new form of warfare. I was sent to the front line of the API description wars in July 2010. Battles were heating up and there was a need for someone to be covering the front lines, documenting how this new type of warfare was being waged. Much like computer origins in World War II, where encryption and compute capacity were central to planning, communicating, executing attacks, APIs are how the submarines of the Internet age that are attacking shipping convoys, and how the looting of gold, art, and other riches are being dispatched–a distributed Enigma for a new type of warfare that was born out of the technology of the last world war, but retooled for a new century of warfare. In the early days, API attacks were carried out using WSDL, an XML format for describing each networked attacks as a set of targeting endpoints that receive messages which contained attack orders that are either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information, executed from high up the common and control chain, by IT leadership. This new type of war was orchestrated by a small group of greybeards, who dwelled in the basements of large institutions. Around the turn of the century, a new breed of milia units began borrowing from these existing top-down approaches to digital warfare but began leveraging cheaper Internet and web infrastructure to document, share, and distribute their unique brand of attacks on the global supply chains of not just the enemy, but anyone that got in their way–a new, ruthless way of waging a digital economic war. It would be several more years before this type of warfare would take root and begin evolving, but the seeds for disruption had been planted, giving birth to something that would soon be affecting every other aspect of business, government, institutions, and even in our personal worlds. Early cyber invasions seemed almost fun and entering, but looking back the attack on the social fabric of our lives, it was anything but amusing. Who ever imagined that warfare could be conducted via social media memes, photos, videos, and the games we play each day. APIs were being used to define and map out more than just the social fabric of our personal and professional lives, they were being used to psychologically profile us, and ultimately plan out how we could be conscripted in this new type of cyber warfare. By this point, one of the leading militias called Amaze who had been pushing this new type of warfare had heavily invested the digital factories and warehouses where they manufactured the essential components...]]></content>

    <title>Patent Storytelling #DesignFiction</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/11/patent-storytelling-designfiction/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[I am a patent storyteller. I craft and file patents that are in the speculative, moonshot, design fiction, science fiction, and storyteller categories. These patents aren't mean to describe an actual product line. They are purely intended to boost the profile of our client company's patent catalog and get people talking about them.
Back in 2005, I was working as a patent attorney, and I noticed the unrealistic nature of the patents I was being hired to write. What really defined the shift for me was that US Patent Office was actually accepting and approving these wildly unrealistic, often comprehensive and abstract filings. It was the gold rush for filing technology patents, and building your company's portfollio before anything changed--a decade later, nothing has changed.
Along the way I decide to offer my clients an enhanced, more creative edition of my services that I am calling &quot;patent storytelling&quot;. While patents are still filed, become real, tangible intellectual property, the intent behind them is all about stimulating the imagination of tech bloggers and journalists who pay attention to the patent catalogs of leading companies. The marketing value of these patent stories far exceeds any cost associated with the crafting and filing of these legal documents.
We live in a magical time. The Internet is an amazing virtual world where anything is possible. While we do keep our storytelling somewhat in alignment with a customer's product roadmap, we specialize in telling stories that give the media and blogosphere the compelling stories they want to tell, providing them with the entertainment their readers demand. While stimulating the imagination of the media, and potentially the new and existing customers, patent storytelling has the best impact on the competitors of the companies we work for, making them work much harder to understand where a company might be headed.
I can't identify specific pieces we've produced, but our clients include 80% of fortune 500 companies, and all of the leading tech companies you know and trust. I will let you look through their patent catalogs, and decide with filings are patent storytelling, and which ones are not on your own

    <title>Racial Bias In Algorithm &amp; Color Blind Facial Recognition Targets White Minority #DesignFiction</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/racial-bias-in-algorithm-color-blind-facial-recognition-targets-white-minority-designfiction/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[
Algorithmic policing using facial recognition technology has been in place in 98% of police departments in the United States for almost 11 years now. The full report about the last decade has become available, and the results have clearly been devastating to the white population. Due to arrest decisions being made 100% algorithmically, and the fact that facial recognition technology is largely blind to people of color, the last decade of policing has largely targeted the now minority white population.
Blind faith in the algorithms and a lack of diversity amongst facial recognition development teams created this perfect storm. While it has been devastatingly effective in incarcerating the white population, it would have to remain in operation for another century before we would see the scales tipped back in the favor of people of color. It does provide a wonderful reminder of how privilege&amp;nbsp;and a lack of diversity can really bite you in the ass&amp;nbsp;when you believe so religiously in the power of the algorithm.
Nobody is sure what will happen next. Can we go back to a world of human policing? Mistrust of human police offer still exists, but now with a complete lack of trust of the policing algorithms, nobody&amp;nbsp;trusts the new system either. Most advocates are in favor of leaving in place, and living with the bias built into the facial recognition systems, until a&amp;nbsp;solution can be found--we lived with it knowingly built into the human version for so long, why be in such a hurry to change course now? Solving the diversity problem on facial recognition technology development teams seems like the only path forward at this time.]]></content>

    <title>The Money Is In Selling Access To Unsecured Devices Not The Devices #DesignFiction</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/the-money-is-in-selling-access-to-unsecured-devices-not-the-devices-designfiction/"/>

    <content><![CDATA[
I am telling you that all you need is for each of your devices to respond to your presale validation requests and you can sell it many times over, to a variety of cybersecurity players. You can sell to the Chinese, to the Russian, a variety of rogue actors, and even to some researchers and news outlets. The money in all of this isn't in the manufacturing, and selling of IoT devices, or even the data generated from them--it is selling unsecured access to them once they are plugged into any network.
A camera, microphone, speaker, light, crockpot, or any other device--it doesn't matter. The smaller, cheaper, and more entertaining the better. You manufacture&amp;nbsp;in large quantities, ship in bulk, and encourage the giving away of each device making it irresistible for users to plug it into their network. The more devices you can muster with a presale device validation ping, the more you can request from your buyers, with the&amp;nbsp;market for these type of buyers growing by 200X in the next six months.
The trick is to stay in tune with each trend in wearables, home, and office gear. This week it's the workplace cubicle fan that measures the temperature, and next week its the mini lava lamp posting your mood to Twitter. The Internet connectivity should be simple, convenient, and entertaining, making plugging it into the network rewarding for the user. Once this is done, each device can ping home its availability&amp;nbsp;for command and control. There are a growing number of trade magazines that cover the device trends, but usually by the time they've been covered it is yesterday's news, so you have to do your own research.
Take a look at our catalog, crunch the number in the spreadsheet template we provided you with--you will see the numbers pencil out for selling access to these unsecured devices, not selling the devices themselves.&amp;nbsp;]]></content>

    <title>The Invasion Began In The 19th Century With Early Radio Waves #DesignFiction</title>

    <updated>2016-10-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[
From what we now know, the invasion began in the early 20th century, with early signals sent to our invaders via experimentation in radio waves in the mid 19th century. Early forms of communication did not draw their attention like the signals we sent by radio, television, telephone, the Internet, and cellular technology. Each wave of technology matched the accompanying wave of the invasion, with our adoption of these innovations laying the groundwork of our own demise.
While radio and television demonstrated that we were a society worth invading, it wasn't until the Internet age, that the full-scale invasion began, leaving no place on earth out of reach from the invading force. Within 50 years of the Internet being unleashed on the world, all&amp;nbsp;humanity was under the full control of our invading species. Because we led our own invasion, we did not see our invaders, they looked like us, spoke like we did, and desired the same things we desired. We attacked each other, in the service of our invaders, and we called in cyber warfare.
There were warnings all along the way, that technology was bad, and we ignored all the signs. We told stories in books, music, and movies, all of which became distractions, numbing us from being able to actually see our invading force. With capitalism as a vehicle, we reduced everyone&amp;nbsp;and everything to a transaction. Each thought, message, idea, emotion became a commodity&amp;nbsp;and fuel for the invading force. We swapped out our DNA for blockchain command and control, building our own prison, and walking in when our invaders commanded.

    <title>Fees For IoT Device Security Violations Are Automatic #DesignFiction</title>

    <content><![CDATA[
When you purchase your security camera, router, printer, or other potentially Internet-connected device and plug it in on your network, you will have to complete its activation. When you purchased your IoT device, this was just the first half of the activation sequence, once you get connected to your network, you will need to execute the second half of activation sequence.
At this time your device will operate as expected, and is registered in multiple federal and state agencies databases. When your device manufacturer releases a firmware update for the device you will have 72 hours to apply the update, or face an IoT device compliance violation. Depending on the device, it starts around $25.00 with a 5% daily increase for each day of non-compliance.&amp;nbsp;
Your manufacturer may have automatic updates turned on by default, resulting in the most desirable update schedule for everyone involved. For some reason, some manufacturers haven't made this default, and some installers opt to turn off when it is present. This is one reason we've automated the violation framework, to incentivize compliant activations. There are many proprietary and open source solutions available today that assist you in the management of your IoT devices, helping you stay in compliance with government IoT device security regulations--it shouldn't be a problem.
While IoT device security compliance may seem like yet another regulatory hurdle to have to climb over as a small business owner, it hopefully gives you the opportunity to pause while determining which objects you connect to the Internet. We all have to share in the burden of online security and assume our responsibility for each device we decide to connect to the online world.]]></content>

    <title>We Offer A Redundant Proxy For The Facebook Live API #DesignFiction</title>
    <link href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/13/we-offer-a-redundant-proxy-for-the-facebook-live-api-designfiction/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <content><![CDATA[
Use our API proxy for your mobile video applications instead of directly connecting to Facebook Live API. The proxy ensures your video is uploaded to Facebook Live, as well as up to 10 other locations, depending on how important syndication is to you. With the numerous claims against Facebook regarding censorship of videos we know we can't trust them, but with the network effect present we also can't ignore the benefits the platform offers for spreading the message.
We offer ten alternate locations for your video to be uploaded to in real-time, including Youtube, Vimeo, as well as more storage-oriented&amp;nbsp;locations like Amazon S3 and Dropbox, allowing access beyond just video and social locations. We recommend hitting all the top video sharing platforms, as well as 3-5 standard storage locations, which will then allow for further syndication using Content Delivery Networks (CDN).&amp;nbsp;
Depending on the sensitive nature of the content, and the political influence that target(s) possess, we recommend syndicating as many possible locations as you can afford. If you are restricted to just using the Facebook application to make this happen, we recommend using our local area network proxy, which can act as a proxy for your entire network, and route a copy of all videos to the locations you need.
Do not rely on Facebook as the only source for storage and distribution. You need the network effect Facebook offers, but they cannot be trusted to be the sole gatekeepers of the video that is defining our times--they have made this clear.]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[
Our fleets of drone deployed radio frequency (RF) spectrum scanners can be deployed as a cohesive mesh, producing 100% scanning coverage wherever you need them--within an hour. Each drone logs everything. All signals are recorded and synced with the cloud in real-time, where our systems get to work identifying devices, and matching with existing intelligence.&amp;nbsp;
Depending on your intelligence data subscription you should have access to all updates within minutes of the data coming in from the drones. Each drone fleet will establish the mesh coverage needed, based upon the KML file we upload. If we need to expand in the region at any point, additional drones will be deployed in real-time and fill in any gaps--immediately reporting all signals found.
Our RF scanning fleets do not allow for any decision-making capabilities, that is up to your systems--we just provide the data. RF scanning drones are specialized--they do one thing well. They track on all available RF signals available in the area we tell them to, that is all they are capable of doing. If you need more information on other types of specialized drone fleets we offer, or data enabled decision-making solutions, let me know, and I'll get the required information you desire.]]></content>

We are the Waze for drones. Instead of routing cars and trucks we provide routing options for the commercial drone industry. Drone routing adds another critical dimension to the process--elevation. What fixed objects are in the way, like buildings, bridges, and trees. What temporary objects are in the way like cranes, cables, and other drone traffic. There are an increasingly amount of objects in the way of the fast moving drone sector.
Real-time, near real-time, and historical drone routing data has proven to be a 10 trillion dollar industry. With over 30 billion commercial drones in operation, the need for routing solutions has reached critical levels. Real-time tracking systems have been in place for commercial drone operators for over three years now, adding to the amount of data we process, and share each day. Thanks to the use of drone technology new construction is mapped each day--adding to the fixed layer of our maps in real time.&amp;nbsp;
What you are looking for is our historical data solutions, which includes the rating for each zone on the map. Historical mode for the API is not meant to be used by drones during flights&amp;nbsp;but is designed for use in a system to system integrations, primarily used by the insurance industry. The historical data includes all drone accidents back to 2018, which should provide what you are looking. Let us know if your current access levels to the historical drone data give you everything you need--if not we can bump you up a level or two.]]></content>

The first task at hand is to know the top products that are in place when it comes to the common ailments our senate leadership faces. Knowing the equipment they use is important, but knowing of the best product available is more important, so I can advise on sensible product decisions when new treatments are advised by doctors. All senators are required to consult with my office on all health care decisions--we still have the occasional rogue senator, but for the most part, they are all in compliance.
The second part of my work is focused on paying attention to all claims of healthcare devices having security vulnerabilities. I work to validate them as soon as they come in and identify the senators in which these vulnerabilities will impact. Once we have a compromised device we work to mitigate the risk by switching out the device if possible or keeping them on a limited access plan until proper updates, and patches can be applied. A big part of this is often asking journalists to leave out details of a senator's health, or details on the specific device they use.
More senators are using connected healthcare devices, especially amongst the elder ones. More devices are being connected to a network and the Internet. Making my job increasingly difficult. Information sharing is critical to what I do, but it has to be done in a thoughtful way, otherwise I'm just making senators a target. It all keeps me on my toes, but it is a worthy job&amp;nbsp;and helps keep our country's leaders safe, as the Internet continues to make our world both safer and more dangerous, all in the same motion.]]></content>

Do you want the free publicity that can come with a security breach? We are the creative team you are looking for. We have the experience to help you craft and execute exactly the perfect scenario and help you achieve your goals.
In today's online volatile cyber security landscape the stage is set, all you have to do is seize the moment. Our most popular package is the perceived external threat solution, where we take one of your products, stage a security incident and leak it to the online folks. There is no better way to light the fire under your team's ass then to make them think there is a security hole in the solutions they are developing.
The second most popular package is the competitor misinformation play. We will target one of your competitor's products, and plan just the right security incident for the situation. All we do is leak the information, and the current journalism and blogger landscape takes care of the rest. Cybersecurity fears even trump those of the environment and terrorism, making it the best way to get publicity for your company. Remember any news coverage is good news coverage, it just depends on how you roll with it.
Once we receive your&amp;nbsp;down payment, one of our creative directors will reach out to you with a full list of packages, as well as non-disclosure information.
