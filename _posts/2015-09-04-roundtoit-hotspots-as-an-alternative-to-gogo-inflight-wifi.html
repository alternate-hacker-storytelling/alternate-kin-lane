<p>We are proud to announce our new RoundToIt Hotspot for you to network with during your airline journeys, as an alternative to expensive, and unreliable Gogo Inflight Wifi. How have you felt after each flight you shelled out the $10-40 per trip for Wifi? Unsatisfied with speeds, and what you were actually able to get accomplished during the time you were "connected"?</p>
<p>Rather than wasting your time sharing a dial up connection with 50 other passengers, connect to your RoundToIt, and get done, the shit you should actually be doing. All those things you said you would get done when you get a round to it, you can now get done!! I will read that book when I get a round to it -- done! I will write this detective novel I have had in my head when I get a round to it -- done! I will write an actual physical letter to my mother when I get a round to it -- done!</p>
<p>When you have a&nbsp;RoundToIt Hotspot, your laptop, tablet, and mobile phone will automatically connect to your own hotspot, rather than the airport wifi or Gogo Inflight wifi. You will then be given an interactive list of the things you should actually be doing in your life, rather than wasting your time, and money on bearable usable wifi networks.</p>
