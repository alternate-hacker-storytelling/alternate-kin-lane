<p>The beauty in the Apple Watch program is its been in use for years, and now that we&rsquo;ve called our recent device an Apple Watch you think it is new. We&rsquo;ve been watching you for years, and now that we are talking about it publicly, you are even more excited than we could ever imagine.</p>
<p>We are watching you. We are watching everything you do. We are tracking all of your data, from your location, to the apps you use, and the pictures and videos you take. We watch everything you do&mdash;we just wanted to let you know.</p>
<p>You are under the watchful gaze of Apple Watch, not in some disconnected surveillance sense, but like a mother watching over her children&mdash;Apple is watching you. We want to understand, and know you better so we can better serve yo. This is the Apple watch.</p>
