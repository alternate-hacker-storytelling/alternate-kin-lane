<p>As a family, we have been saving up for 3 years now so that we can afford to buy a copy of our grandma's and grandpa's digital data. Unfortunately our parents fell on hard times and could not make the monthly payments across our grandparents digital accounts, resulting in them being put into collection.</p>
<p>Collection will hang on to data in perpetuity, but charge a 3% interest rate each year it is held. When their data went into collection, over $4,000.00 was owed, and after almost 35 years in collection, after interest and fees, we owe almost $60,000 USC (US Credits). Next month we should have it all saved up, and are starting to get excited about what we will see, when we get the data.</p>
<p>We know there is almost 500 terabytes of photos, videos, messages, and other life bits from our grandparent's lives, including the valuable connections with our own parent's data. Nothing is worse than clicking on a childhood photo shared on your parents account, and get a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">COLLECTION</span> page, stating before you can view anything, the balance needs paying. #Embarrassing ;-(</p>
<p>In 2090, our own digital account payments exceeds what we pay for anything else in our lives, including our housing. Unless something bad happens, we will make sure and keep up on our payments, so that the same thing doesn't happen to us. You have to think about the future, and the legacy you will leave for your children.&nbsp;</p>
