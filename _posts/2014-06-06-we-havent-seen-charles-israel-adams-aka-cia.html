<p>The young man who used to own the Twitter handle @cia hasn&rsquo;t been see for a couple weeks, and now the Central Intelligence Agency as now taken over control over his Twitter account, formerly owned and ran by Charles Israel Adams.</p>
<p>The @cia Twitter account had been actively under control by Mr. Adams, and he was a prolific tweeter until a little under 3 weeks ago.  In the last 24 hours the account was essentially reset and is now actively representing the federal agency, and tweets are now coming directly from the CIA.</p>
<p>We spoke with Charles&rsquo;s parents in Chicago, and his girlfriend who lived with him in New York City, and everyone is very concerned regarding his whereabouts. He never missed a day when it came to tweeting, and they just want him to come home.</p>
