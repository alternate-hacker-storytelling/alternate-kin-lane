     The young man who used to own the Twitter handle @cia hasn’t been see for a couple weeks, and now the Central Intelligence Agency as now taken over control over his Twitter account, formerly owned and ran by Charles Israel Adams.
</p>
<p>
     The @cia Twitter account had been actively under control by Mr. Adams, and he was a prolific tweeter until a little under 3 weeks ago. In the last 24 hours the account was essentially reset and is now actively representing the federal agency, and tweets are now coming directly from the CIA.
</p>
<p>
     We spoke with Charles’s parents in Chicago, and his girlfriend who lived with him in New York City, and everyone is very concerned regarding his whereabouts. He never missed a day when it came to tweeting, and they just want him to come home.
