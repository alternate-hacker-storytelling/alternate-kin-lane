<p>Hi there, I'm Pliny the Elder Keg #18, also known as Nick. I'm a 3rd generation smart keg who was just tapped, and ready to party. The usual lifespan of any tapped keg of Pliny the Elder is 72 hours, and I intend to make the most of my time here on earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm connecting you via Facebook, because you've enjoyed Pliny on tap in the neighborhood before, and I consider you a friend of the brewery. As of 4PM today, I am on tap at Joeys Pub on 4th and Broadway. If for some reason you can't make it this week let me know, and I'll pass your information on to future generations, and if they are tapped in your neighborhood, we will let you know.</p>
<p>Also make sure and follow me on Twitter, as I'll be Tweeting out some deals tonight. The more you engage on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, the more I'll include you in future keg announcements and discussions. You can email, Tweet, and FB message with me just like you could any other friend, and I'll respond--while each keg is unique, we share a collective memory, and we never forget our friends.</p>
<p>You are one of only 23 people I've contacted today, so make sure you come visit tonight, because tomorrow might be too late. Make sure you bring your friend Sam, and Mary, as they seemed to have a blast three weeks ago at Joey's Pub, and I can tell Mary has had a particularly bad week, and could use a pick-me-up.</p>
<p>We'll see you at Joey's dude -- your friend Nck (Pliny the Elder Keg #18).&nbsp;</p>
