<p>We have all but won the great war against the United States. Their own fear set into motion their downfall, and proved what an inferior society they really are. Through technology we are able to scale up the war, with very little casualties of our own people.</p>
<p>It all began with their cultural shift back to supporting individual gun ownership. The illness and fear that is American gun ownership peaked in 2018 with a series of mass shootings, resulting in over 80% individual gun ownership across the country. The new gun ownership pushed fear to new levels, making every US city a tinderbox for terrorism.</p>
<p>In the early days we needed one martyr, and at least five to ten "mimics" to incite an attack. We would target a public place, usually in smaller to mid-sized towns, and a team would find an adequate public location with 20 or more people, and the martyr would yell out death to the infidels (or some other war cry), hold their finger up like they had a gun, and the Americans would do the rest.</p>
<p>In about 50% of the situations, the Americans would shoot each other, or once law enforcement arrived they wouldn't be able to tell anyone apart and chaos would ensue. We quickly learned the importance of "mimics" who would position themselves behind average citizens who had guns, and after shots were fired, they'd yell whatever was said by the martyr behind an average citizen--resulting in others thinking they were a bad guy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such a climate of fear, it is easy to make others think anyone is a bad guy, by mimicking the bad guy everyone just witnessed. You do this five to ten times in a crowded, then lay down on the ground, and the fearful Americans do the rest. As a mimic, it helps if you choose to stand behind someone who doesn't look white, it really doesn't matter which race, white people can't tell the difference and will shoot at any brown person with a gun.</p>
<p>In 2020, we are finding that we now do not need mimics. Through carefully placed or hacked mobile devices, we can make any cell phone do the work of a mimic. We are also now testing our new martyr devices that can tell when someone has stood up in a crowded room, and blast a common war cry, and people begin shooting. If you trigger half of the devices in any classroom or public location to do the same, anyone with a gun will begin shooting.</p>
<p>It has never been easier to fly into America if you do not have a gun. We have our jihadest placed all around the country, and we are looking to triple the number of attacks we accomplished in 2019. Fear in the United States is at an all time high, everyone has a gun, and they will do all the work for us. We find it harder to accomplish our attacks bigger cities, because gun ownership seems to lower, but we have no problem killing 20-50 people in any small town across the country.</p>
<p>With sustained attacks throughout the year, and our regular cyberattacks on the financial, and government systems of the country, we should have sufficiently weaked the United States, and prepared for phase two our plan by 2022.</p>
