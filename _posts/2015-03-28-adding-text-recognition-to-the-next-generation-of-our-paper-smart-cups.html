<p>We just released version 7.3 of our mart coffee cups, paper edition. The paper cups we sell to mainstream coffee shops, is over 83% of our business, enjoying the business of customers like Starbucks, Peets, and many more of the top brands in coffee. We provide all the cups, as well as all the business intelligence that goes with it, to almost the entire retail coffee industry.</p>
<p>The smart paper cup is known for its ability to measure quality and temperature of coffee made in shops around the world, and with bluetooth technology, each coffee cup communicates with the store Point of Sale (POS). We are also known for changing the game last year by introducing the same features for coffee cups that left the store, even providing data on how much trash is produced outside the store, and who properly recycles their cups.</p>
<p>With the latest release of paper cups we have introduced text recognition for all our coffee cups. Store employees, and customers can write on their coffee cups in any pen, pencil, or even crayon, and using a patent pending text recognition technology, the text is scanned and stored in a central database. This new ability to use store cups for feedback and communication, is unprecedented, and provides stores with a new digital channel for listening to their customers.</p>
<p>As part of the release we are working with Starbucks on their &ldquo;Get The Word Out&rdquo; initiative for election 2020, and Peets Coffee on a doodle art contest, where customers can win free prizes by creating the best doodles on the sides of coffee cups. This is jus the tip of the iceberg when comes to opportunities around the text recognition capabilities of our smart coffee cup series. Make sure and contact your rep to find out more about when the next generation coffee cups are coming to your area, and how you can use the new text recognition features as part of your marketing and promotions.</p>
