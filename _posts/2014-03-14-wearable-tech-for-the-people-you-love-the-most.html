<p>Technology plays an important role in our lives, allowing us to better connect with the people that are most important to us. We all want to know that the people we love are safe, sound, and close to our hearts. What better way to do this than through Internet connected wearable technology, and mobile apps we can use on our smartphones.</p>
<p>My company sells popular clothing lines, including coats, shirts, pants, underwear, socks, and shoes for men, women and children, with one major difference&mdash;we embed Internet connected sensors in all of our clothing. Every item we sell can be immediately connected to your account at time of purchase, immediately giving you access to manage all clothing items as part of a single account via your smart phone, and on the web.</p>
<p>Clothing sensors provide you with vital information about your family's clothes, including time of purchase, products specs, and opportunities for product replacement or additional item purchase. Sensors also provide enhanced geo services including location, elevation, whether someone is lying down, if clothes are being worn, and other vital details about each item of clothing.</p>
<p>If you children is lying in a ditch somewhere, you will know&mdash;no more worries. If your husband is screwing that secretary of his in that sleazy hotel down the street you will know. Today's wearable technology doesn't just give you control over your wardrobe and purchasing decisions, but gives you control over your family.</p>
<p>If you do not find the products you are looking for in our catalog, let us know. We are working on adding new brands, and product types to our catalog. We want to make sure you can find all the wearable technology you need, to keep the people you love, looking good and staying safe!</p>
