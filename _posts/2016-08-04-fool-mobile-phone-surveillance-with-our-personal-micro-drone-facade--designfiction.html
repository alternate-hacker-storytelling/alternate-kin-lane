<p>Need to go somewhere and you don't want law enforcement&nbsp;or even that nosey boss or wife of yours knowing about? Boy, do we have the person drone for you! The new facade edition of our microdrone can clone your iPhone, and can mimic all or part of your daily activities for you, while you are out doing what you need to get done.</p>
<p>All it takes is 30 days worth of log files on your cell phone, and your personal micro drone will perform any activity you choose. All you do is browse the available activities, and community behavior templates via your smartphone app, pick the chosen schedule&nbsp;and go. The drone will do the rest, even hovering outside your office window pretending you are at work.</p>
<p>While your&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #f5f6f5;">micro-drone</span>&nbsp;is acting on your behalf your cell phone will automatically&nbsp;go into an incognito mode, giving full control over the drone to broadcast your location, and even tweet, take photos and perform other activities as you need. Obviously, there are limitations, but to anyone tracking your location via your regular social channels, it will appear you are behaving as usual.</p>
<p>The new facade micro-drone is not just for eluding surveillance, it can also be used to broadcast new and interesting journeys, that maybe you don't have the time to take, using the community preprogrammed facades. There are trips to the park, zoo, beach, and many other activities you would like to be doing, but may not have the time or money to do so.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #f5f6f5;">micro-drone</span>&nbsp;facade is available on our website, or through the Amazon store--get yours now!</p>
