     During <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in New York City</a>, there was an awesome gathering of developer evangelists at the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard">Tumblr</a> offices, for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycevangelists/events/104141492/" target="_blank">NYC Evangelist Meetup</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I got the chance to hang out with several evangelist I know online, but have never met in person.  We drank beers, ate pizza and talked about all things evangelist, evangelism, advocacy and hopefully some normal shit too.

<p>
     Thanks for having me over everyone!  Have you ever seen so many evangelists in one room?
