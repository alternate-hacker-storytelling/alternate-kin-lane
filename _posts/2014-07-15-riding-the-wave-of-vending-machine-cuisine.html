<p>I got in early. I saw a new thing, that I felt was the future, and I rode the wave in. I started a blog in 2014, called My Vending, which focused the world of vending machine cuisine. It all started with a <a href="http://tastetheburritobox.com/">single vending machine burrito</a>, building on the momentum of the food truck movement, and all of a sudden we found ourselves in a new era of self-service, vending machine cuisine, that was feeding America.</p>
<p>Five years later, we find a whole new world of specialist engineers, designing and building the next generation of self-contained, food vending machines. It started with simple food formula&mdash;the burrito. From there we championed all the american food classics that we&rsquo;ve co-opted from other countries, including the pizza, burgers, tacos, hot dogs, fish &amp; chips, and other staples of everyday society.</p>
<p>Vending culinary engineers have since specialized in unique techniques for storing raw ingredients, as well as prepped components, then delivering on demand in a self-service environment. At first the quality of food was similar to convenience store food, but just like we saw with the food truck movement, eventually vending machines began delivering some innovative culinary dishes, that just worked.</p>
<p>I knew if I got in early, I could make a name for myself. I saw the BurritoBox vending machine, and new this was going to be something, and started My Vending. It took a few years before other strong players emerged, but eventually pizza, hot dog, and burrito vending machines were ubiquitous. That is when things began to change, and you started seeing neighborhood, and regional vending solutions who specialized in unique dishes, and food combinations you could find nowhere else.</p>
<p>Now in 2020, the world of vending machine cuisine has exploded, and my blog is the original source of information for the movement. Technology has forever changed how we feed the american family, providing a range of self-service, nutritious, and very tasty vending machines across the urban, and sub-urban landscape.</p>
