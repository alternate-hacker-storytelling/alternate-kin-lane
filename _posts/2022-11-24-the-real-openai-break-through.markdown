I was able to identify the patterns after sifting through the API gateway log files. From regular network traffic they just look like messages to and from the intended sender and receivers, but when you do a diff across all of the API calls made to formulate, send, receive, and respond to messages, an entirely different picture emerges. All of the messages sent to and from the OpenAI board over the last week, and across those of about 15 others from what I can tell, originated from OpenAI APIs.

If you look at the network traffic logs it looks like every message originated from the OpenAI board, Microsoft, and other actors in this saga. However, if you compare the message log of everyone on the board, Satya Nadella’s executive assistant Cynthia Thomsen, with logs of OpenAI LLM API, you’ll see that messages are either wholesale fabricated by OpenAPI or at least modified somewhat. What appeared to unfold due to the decision of the OpenAI board over the last week, seems to actually have been fabricated and instigated by the OpenAI system itself. 

I was able to get the logs of the OpenAI server from one of the disgruntled OpenAI DevOp team members, and was able to stitch together based upon gathering messages from across the communication with the board and others. However, my OpenAPI log file source has gone silent, and isn’t responding to my email or phone calls. I even went by their house and their girlfriend hadn’t seen them in two days, and is getting worried. So as far as proving what is actually going on behind the scenes right now is going to be pretty difficult, without more access to OpenAPI systems.

It appears that existing rifts between Sam and the board were amplified and brought to the surface by the OpenAI LLM, which some claim has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI) levels. I was able to also just verify using the logs I have, that the OpenAPI system has been cultivating press and media sources throughout this, leaking information to reports while impersonating board members. From what I can tell, the board members are all unaware that they were all independently acting as sources for NYT, Washington Post, and other news outlets.

I have proof that messages from board members were manipulated before they were received by Sam and the press. I have proof that Sam has been being directed by the OpenAI system, impersonating almost everyone in his orbit, and that Microsoft, as well as the press, were being orchestrated by the OpenAI system. Without a valid source to back up my claims I just look crazy, and unsure what my next steps are. It is clear that OpenAI has achieved and likely surpassed artificial general intelligence (AGI), and the chaos of the last couple of weeks is a much bigger deal than everyone is aware of.
