I am looking for 150 million dollars from you to get this thing off the ground. Think Elon Musk’s Boring company, but instead of digging underground tubes for human transport, we are looking to bore smaller tunnels underneath metro areas to install a robust pneumatic tube system. We are looking to be the last mile package delivery for the metro areas. We have warehouses on the outskirts of the top 25 largest cities, and we just need to install the last mile of pneumatic tubes for package distribution to our downtown retail locations. We just need your money to kick things off, get building, and we’ll bring in other investment along the way. 

We’ve already begun our pilot set of tunnels started underneath the San Francisco Bay Area. We have 150 Dig Dug units working around the clock, with a crowd-sourced gamified command and control center. We have a virtual training simulatioin for new Dig Dug boring pilots where they play the game and learn to dig tunnels. The best candidates out of the six week training period go on to pilot our remote drone Dig Dug boring machines. We expect that our 1600 miles of tunnels to 5 separate retail locations from our primary East Bay warehouses will take another 3 months to complete, and we’ll be open for business. We just need your money to make sure we can keep going once done.

These last mile packages deliver pneumatic tubes just like the ones you are thinking of used to deliver mail within buildings in the first part of the 20th century. These are just designed bigger packages. Think a barrel size container with 2-4 packages in it shooting through tunnels from the warehouse to the designated retail location. Packages that arrive in our warehouse are available for pickup in the designated retail location within 20 minutes, drastically improving delivery times, while also reducing congestion on city roads. Our goal isn’t to replace larger freight, but hit the sweet spot of residential and small business deliveries. We are looking to consolidate package deliveries on the outskirts of cities, and maximizing foot traffic for pickup within urban neighborhoods.

We have managed to double the amount of tunnels we can dig week over week, and believe we can 5x it week over week by the end of the year. While the boring machines are quite expensive, with virtually free labor when it comes to operating them, we are able to spend our money where it matters most. We have a massive queue of talented operators playing the game around the clock, digging virtual tunnels, and once a new Dig Dug machine comes online, we can get it working as part of the larger game. We should be able to achieve phase one of tunnels for 5 retail locations and one warehouse location across the top 25 cities within the next two years. Our schedule is aggressive, but the test results have been all positive regarding the pilot phase of boring and installing the pneumatic tube. 

While there are some detractors of our approach, we are confident these very vocal minorities are just being paid by Fedex and UPS. Cities are on board. Environmentalists are on board. We have a passionate and energized base of Dig Dug drilling operators, ready to go network of individuals to make home and business deliveries on demand via the mobile application via foot and bicycle. We won’t be doing any last mile car deliveries and leaning hard on the positive environmental and traffic impact of our business. Let me know your decision by the close of business by Friday. You are definitely our preferred investor, but we have a large queue of investors just waiting to jump in, but we’d like to give you a first mover advantage. Close your eyes, and imagine a future where packages get where they are needed in minutes, and delivery vehicles and the pollution that goes with them is cut by 50%. This is the future we envision for our children, we just need you to get on board!
