     Hey my name is creature, I live up on the hill in Portland, OR. I am your local weed dealer. I've started a new drone delivery service in the PDX area.
</p>
<p>
     I can deliver up to an ounce of weed 12 PM to 12AM, seven days a week. Just visit pdxdronedelivery.com and there is an account setup and ordering system available there.
</p>
<p>
     You pay me in Bitcoin, and receive the herb strain of the day, which is my choice from day to day. Your package will come as an Amazon delivery, and will be send to a fictitious name and address, but will be delivered at your location.
</p>
<p>
     Once you get served by drone, you'll never go back to asshole dealer you've had until now. We live in the future!
