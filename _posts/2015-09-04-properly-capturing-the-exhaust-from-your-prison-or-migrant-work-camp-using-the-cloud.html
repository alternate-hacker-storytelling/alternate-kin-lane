<p>You have hundreds, or even thousands of people within the walls of your facility, and are looking for new ways to capitalize on the exhaust from this "unfortunate" situation. A computer terminal is the new widget factory assembly line, and you need to make sure there is a terminal available for each body within your walls, maximizing the value from each person.</p>
<p>First, we'll provide the terminal, and the "internet experience", allowing your users to engage with family, friends, and a sanctioned version of the World Wide Web. In exchange for access to the social graph of your "workforce", we'll provide a limited online experience to keep your individuals engaged. Our proprietary algorithm will personalize the minimal viable engagement necessary to keep your enter work base engaged, but also incentivized to do more work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prisons, worker, and concentration camps of the past pushed workers to dig ditches, mine valuable minerals, and do the physical work necessary to achieve objectives. Modern camps incentivize workers through a minimal viable connection with the world, family, and friends, as well as the lowest bar regarding what is necessary to house, and feed them. Modern approaches to institutional management provide a much more humane, and seemingly friendly approach to controlled human population management.</p>
<p>With a growing prison population, and a skyrocketing migrant population in key areas around the globe, you need a sophisticated approach to managing these exploding populations. Not only will our company give you tools for successfully controlling these growing populations, we will give you proven tools for generating revenue from these controlled segments of your population. Don't hesitate, contact us today for a limited field test at the facility of yur choice.</p>
