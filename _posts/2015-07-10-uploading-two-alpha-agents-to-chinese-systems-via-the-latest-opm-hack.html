<p>The recent hack of the Office of Personnel Management was the first pilot in a new alpha, top secret singularity program. While there were almost a million real profiles leaked as part of the hack, the rest were fabricated as part of the outreach effort. The goal is not to convince the Chinese of the validaty of all records, but to hide the fact that there are two special profiles in the mix.</p>
<p>Two of the identities that were hacked as part of the breach were a new prototype of CIA agents being tested out, which we are calling singularity light. We uploaded two CIA agent profiles using a new DARPA funded software program, which takes each agent's conscioussness, digitized their personas, allowing them to realize a new existence on the open Internet.</p>
<p>As part of the OPM hack, we had placed the two agent personas where we knew they would be vulnerable. Only time will tell how the agents do, in their Chinese network environment. Each agent is programmed to randomly take action in their new environments, and report back only when they achieve specific objectives (classified).</p>
<p>The collateral damage suffered in the latest OPM hack is definitely worth it, to help make this alpha singularity test a success. While the US is concerned over this latest hack, and the Chinese officials are busy sorting through the data they liberated from federal agency servers, our two agents will be assessing the landscape, waiting for the right time to strike.</p>
