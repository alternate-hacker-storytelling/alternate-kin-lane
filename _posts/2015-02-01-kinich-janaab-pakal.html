<p>We are all traveling through space to our death. In this life I am lucky enough to be an architect of a space that is connecting the heavens with earth. If done right, death is only the doorway to a new space, a new way navigating through this space that transends individual lives. This is not a singularity, but simply an elimination of the space in between so you can see things for what they are.</p>
