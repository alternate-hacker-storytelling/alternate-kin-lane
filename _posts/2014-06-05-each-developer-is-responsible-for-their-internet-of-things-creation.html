<p>Ever since the federal Internet of things (Iot) act went into effect we&rsquo;ve seen an amazing adoption of enforcement frameworks occur, with about 90% saturation across the industry. Iot enforcement frameworks required identity certificates of all developers who work on code, before any Internet enabled device can operate.</p>
<p>The quality of development in the security of Iot architecture has jumped almost 70%, eliminating much of the insecure, dangerous devices and platform frameworks that were the hallmark of early days of IoT.</p>
<p>After holding a handful of individuals responsible for their poor Iot implementations, after tracing their involvement in either the engineering of the device or code, other developers thought twice about deploying poor quality Iot devices.</p>
<p>Being held responsible for what their robots, drones, cameras, automobile, and other Iot devices has transformed what was the wild west of Internet connected devices, into and orderly world where we can depend on every object in our life that is connected to the Internet.</p>
