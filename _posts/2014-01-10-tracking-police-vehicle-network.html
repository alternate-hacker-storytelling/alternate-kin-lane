     With the size and cost of GPS trackers it is getting easier and easier to track the locations of vehicles. Commercial fleets are using are using it to manage their workforce, police use them to track their own vehicles as well as increasingly track the location of criminals.
</p>
<p>
     I've taken advantage of this low cost technology and my ability to develop iOS and Android apps and built my own, private police GPS tracking network. Using a simple GPS tracking device that costs $2 I create easy to deploy tracking units that an army of crowdsourced individuals place on police vehicles in their cities and neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
     Next I've built sensor units that track signals emitted from these units and logs the location and timestamp in multiple locations in the cloud. The locations change regularly and sensor units are trained to stay updated in real-time.
</p>
<p>
     That represents the tracking network. I've built low costs tracking and sensor units and made them available to loose networks of individuals to deploy. Then using the data gathered from sensors nationwide I develop iPhone and Android apps that can be tailored to send push notifications when signals are within a certain radius.
</p>
<p>
     The clients of my police tracking network range form hobbyists and small time thugs to organized crime. Of course the network doesn't track on every vehicle in all cities, but the network is significantly growing and the coverage is at least 50%.
</p>
<p>
     In a world of increased tracking of the average citizen, we can use the same technology to track on law enforcement, providing an important counterbalance to this increasingly troubling world.
