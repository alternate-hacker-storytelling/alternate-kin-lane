<p>My job is to take the profiles generated by the lead analysts, and craft visual memes, that can be shared online. I have been developing my database of images for the last 4 years, allowing me to recall from a large imagebase, as well as prioritize images that have successfully met past objectives, or are used by my unit colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the lead analyst's job to know what each meme signifies, and how it translates into our targeting group speak -- I have never met anyone from that team. My job is to create compelling graphical memes the people want to share on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other popular social networks. They have to be fresh, unique, and fit with the current flow of online memes, but speak to their intended audience--it takes a lot of work, to stay up to speed on what is the latest.</p>
<p>The surveillance meme generation unit has transformed how we track people at the NSA. We don't need people to say "I have guns in my house", we get them to share an "Obama is com'n for your guns" meme. We don't need you and your friends to admit they do drugs at the parties, we circulate relevant memes, and you tell us everything we need to know through your social sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>92% of the hate speech, religious propaganda, and drug culture memes are generated by our department. We churn out thousands of image and video driven messages a day, and aggregate, then index all derivatives, targeting all the concerning layers of society. Memes are the best way to profile a suspect in 2015. Period. Citizens do the work for us, all we have to do is set the tone for all of the conversations occurring online, for any given day.</p>
