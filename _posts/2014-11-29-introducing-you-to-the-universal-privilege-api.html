<p>After signing a brand new deal with Google, we feel confident that now is the time to introduce you to our new Universal Privilege API&reg;. With partners including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Yahoo, and many others, the Universal Privilege API&reg;&nbsp;now provides you with the access you will need to fully manage your online persona(s).</p>
<p>Technology providers retain a lot of information about you&mdash;your keystrokes, locations, photos, videos, and much more. With your Universal Privilege API&reg; access, you don't just have access to view all of this information, you have access to remove it from the system. Not all your information will be deletable by default, with some areas like law enforcement, government, and other more restricted areas, it will require an additional premium fee.</p>
<p>As more of our physical world moves online, through our web surfing, usage of mobile devices, and camera surveillance, vehicle tracking, and law enforcement activity, the need to take control over your data is only going to become more imperative. Using the Universal Privilege API&reg;&nbsp;you can do this today, keeping those damaging surveillance photos, or possibly your Uber usage history from becoming public knowledge.</p>
<p>Once you information is out there, you can't take back, and the Universal Privilege API&reg; lets you address problems before they even occur. The Universal Privilege API&reg; is not available to everyone, and the fact that you are reading this means you have access to a layer of the Internet, meant only for less than .01% of the world. For a monthly subscription you can have access to all of your online data that is generated on about 85% of the platforms available online today.</p>
<p>Do not be caught unprotected, exercise your privilege today, and activate your Universal Privilege API&reg; account today.</p>
