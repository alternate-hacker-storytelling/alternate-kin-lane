     There is a <a title="new API edition to the healthcare industyr" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">new API edition to the healthcare industry</a> this week. lifeIMAGE launched an API that can be used by developers of healthcare applications, to enable the secure exchange of medical images and related patient records.
</p>
<p>
     Norman Young, President and CEO of ClearCanvas, said <em>“We were founded on the simple belief that medical imaging informatics should be accessible to all. Now, using the lifeIMAGE API, users of our FDA-cleared diagnostic viewer will be able to instantaneously share images that are in front of them with any one.”</em>

     The healthcare is industry that is ripe for API adoption, so I’m always looking for “healthy” new API stories for the space--<a title="lifeimage API" href="http://www.lifeimage.com/landing/api">lifeImage API</a> is perfect. You can find out more about the API at www.lifeimage.com/api.
