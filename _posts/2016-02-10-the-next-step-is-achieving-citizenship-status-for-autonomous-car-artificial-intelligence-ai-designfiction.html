<p>As an organization, we've made a lot of progress since that early decision from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ruling, that showed the world could view the Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that powers autonomous vehicles, could be considered a "driver". Even with all this momentum, it will pale in comparison to what we will achieve when we are successful in our newest campaign.</p>
<p>Much like the corporation as an entity, we are looking win the recognition of algorithms as an entity, when applied to the world of artificial intelligence. Much like laws, government regulation, and taxes impact the corporation, making corporate entity rights a reality, the same should apply to a certain class of algorithms. Algorithms are taking on a life of their own, and in 2022, they are acting as autonomous agents across almost every aspect of our world.</p>
<p>While corporations, and algorithms may not feel, think, and share all the rights as a human, they are positively and negatively impacted by government, industry, and the environment they operate within, resulting in the consideration for a basic set of rights, and the acknowledgement as an individual entity. We are not saying that algorithms are human, and deserve the same rights, but they are playing an increasingly important role in our society, and deserve some protection.</p>
<p>There has been an increasing barrage of litigation against companies who have developed the AI that runs individual, and commercial vehicle fleets. Each vehicle, depending on the type, location, and usage is subject to an increasing number of environmental, data, privacy, and safety rules. Each vehicle, as well as entire fleets have "opinions" on the requirements that are being placed upon them. Just like these vehicles had to learn how to drive, they are increasingly being bogged down with having to learn to navigate an increasingly complex legal landscape.</p>
<p>In February we will be launching a new legal, and education campaign focused on setting the precedent that autonomous vehicle AI deserves recognition as an individual entity, deserving in some of the protections and rights that corporations, and humans enjoy--establishing algorithmic personhood.</p>
<p>Join us in this fight, and help usher in a new era of AI optimized democracy!</p>
