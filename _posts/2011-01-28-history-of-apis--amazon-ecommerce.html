<p></p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com Web Services (AWS)</a> allowed third party sites to search and display products from Amazon.com. Product data was made accessible using XML and SOAP.
<p></p>From day one the API was integrated with the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com Affiliate Program</a>, allowing developers to monetize their sites through purchases made at <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> via links from their web sites.
<p></p>Internet visionary Tim O'Reilly was quoted in original Amazon Web Services press release saying, "This is a significant leap forward in the next-generation programmable internet."
<p></p>APIs and Amazon both have roots in e-commerce, but APIs were quickly applied to other areas resulting in the social media, cloud computing and now the mobile technology movements.
