     I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist.  One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs.  
</p>
<p>
     I did some fun research, and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>.  This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo.  
</p>
<p>
     As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact. 
</p>
<p>
     <span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Creators" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">Creators</a></strong> - 3D designers of virtual print objects
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Scanners" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-3d-scanners/">Scanners</a></strong> - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Modeling Software" href="ttp://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-modeling-software/">Modeling Software</a></strong> - Applications for building 3D models
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="File Formats" href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=3599">File Formats</a></strong> - File formats for storing 3D models
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Warehousing" href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=3603">Warehousing</a></strong> - Virtual storage for 3D models
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Marketplaces" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-marketplaces/">Marketplaces</a></strong> - Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">Printers</a></strong> - Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Process &amp; Materials" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-process-materials/">Process &amp; Materials</a></strong> - The process and materials that go into 3D printing
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Makers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-makers/">Makers</a></strong> - The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Delivery" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-delivery/">Delivery</a></strong> - Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <span>Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.</span><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-manufacturing.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /> 
</p>
<p>
     <span>This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas.  </span>I also have a summary post on <a title="ProgrammableWeb.com" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb.com</a> about the role of APIs in 3D printing.
</p>
<p>
     <span>3D Printing is something I will be talking about a lot in 2013.  I think all of these areas I laid out have the potential to be radically transformed by APIs.  I will be taking my original research on 3D printing from 2011 and see where I can evolve it based upon what is going on in the 3D printing space in 2013.   </span>
