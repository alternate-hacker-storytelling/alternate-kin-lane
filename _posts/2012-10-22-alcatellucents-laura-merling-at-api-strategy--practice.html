     When <a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy--practice-conference/">3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl">@magicmerl</a>), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.
</p>
<p>
     As soon as I told her about the event, she said “We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!”
</p>
<p>
     I’m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.</a>

</p>
<p>
     If you’ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there. She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space.  Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.
</p>
<p>
     During Laura’s keynote I’m sure we will here more about <a href="/2012/09/06/alcatel-lucent-open-sources-their-api-management-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove</a>, as well as their openly licensed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/alcatel-lucent-creates-methodology-for-apis-and-makes-available-under-creative-commons/">API lifecycle and methodology</a>.

     Make sure you <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">get registered</a> today, before the event is sold out--there aren’t many tickets left.  I'll see you there.
