<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I apologize for my directness in my response, but I must first address your desire to devalue what I do for a living. Comparing what I do with current anti-drone technology is a personal insult. I will address this topic, once and then if brought up again, it will be the end of our relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What my falcon's do is based upon genetics, upbringing, nurturing, training, and instinct. This is something that algorithms can never achieve, a realm where only god and nature rules. Sure, you can buy anti-drone technology, which you have to constantly keep up to date with the latest release, but if your target area is the small to medium sized drone market--falcons are where its at.</p>
<p>Any of my falcons, with the right care, will remain loyal throughout its life, helping you protect your lands, and never, never let any drone dictate the rules on, or above your domain. Drones have infected our skies, but nature is still superior when it comes to speed, agility, and mission. No program will ever have the raw instincts of well trained, and cared-for falcon.</p>
<p>I understand that I am asking you to spend considerably more money, and carry more responsibility in maintaining the overall relationships with your falcon(s), but the return on investment is far great than you can realize with any anti-drone tech. Leave the technology drone wars to the high altitude, larger drone universe--falcons are what you are looking when it comes to the protection your home and businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to your order, and matching you with just the right falcons from my ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>--Sincerely, Jeb Stewart, Falconer</p>
