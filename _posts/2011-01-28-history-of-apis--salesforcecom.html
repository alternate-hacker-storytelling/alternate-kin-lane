February 7th, 2000 <a href="http://www.salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce.com</a> officially launched at the IDG Demo 2000 conference.
<p></p>Salesforce.com launched its enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service". <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/salesforce/salesforce-original-web-site.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /> XML <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> were part of Salesforce.com from day one. Salesforce.com identified that customers needed to share data across their different business applications, and APIs were the way to do this.
<p></p>Marc R. Benioff, chairman and founder of salesforce.com stated, <em>"Salesforce.com is the first solution that truly leverages the Internet to offer the functionality of enterprise-class software at a mere fraction of the cost."</em>
<p></p>Salesforce.com was the first cloud provider to take an enterprise class web application and API and deliver what we know today as <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/" target="_blank">Software-as-a-Service</a>.
