<p>I wanted to announce Buckit, which is an online bucket conversion system allowing you to mail items to a specific physical address, that is allocated into various buckets, which are directly mapped to virtual Amazon S3 buckets.</p>
<p>Anything you mail into a bucket, will be converted to its virtual equivalent.  A patented physical to virtual mapping algorithm is applied to any physical item received, translating into a virtual version that can be stored forever in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Photos to Images</strong><br /> Any photo sent to your Buckit photo storage will be translated from a physical photo into the png format.</p>
<p><strong>Video to Video</strong><br /> Any video tape, cd or other analog or digital video format sent to your Buckit storage, will be converted into a compatible digital video format.</p>
<p><strong>Paper to Documents</strong><br /> Any physical paper documents, that are single sheet or bound, will be scanned and made available as digital documents in PDF and OCR scan formats.</p>
<p><strong>Household</strong><br /> Any component of your household world sent into a Buckit storage such as screw, cord, mount or any there manufactured component will be converted into a 3D CAD drawing, allowing it to 3D printed at any point. If product can be matched with manufacturer drawings via search, original drawings will be used&mdash;other scanned version will be applied otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Automobile</strong><br /> Any part for your vehicle can automatically added to your Buckit storage. When you purchase a car and register it, all supporting parts will be added as 3D CAD drawings to your Buckit storage. Any part can be printed by and / or sent to your mechanic upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Office</strong><br />When you make purchases at the office, you can automatically add to your company's Buckit storage. You will be granted subscription and upgrade access to common, everyday office supplies. All items in your storage will be available as digital items, until needed, and then can be sent to local 3D printing outlet.</p>
<p>Buckit is your physical to virtual, and back again storage solution in the clouds for an Internet age. You will be able to now efficiently manage all aspects of your physical world, maximizing the wholesale digital storage of physical items, and retrieval of these items back to physical when you need it.</p>
<p>The line between our physical and virtual worlds is blurring, and Buckt is your personal and business bucket storage that can manage the transition between these two aspects of your life.</p>
