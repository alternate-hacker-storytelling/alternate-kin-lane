     <img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/finger-pointing.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />How To Get Your Grandma, Mother, Daughter and Sister to Understand APIs? You stop using gendered approaches when explaining what an API is. I’m not going to cite any of the past or recent examples of this (you know who you are). And I don’t care <em>"how you didn’t even mean to do this"</em>, when you wrote your API example. There really isn’t a line between sexism and ignorant sexism.
</p>
<p>
     If you really want everyone to understand what an API is, provide well written, plain english examples, that are framed around solving a problem your grandma, mother, daughter or or sister will understand--using problems they truly face in their lives.
</p>
<p>
     It really is that simple. As long as you are using gendered terms to describe what we are doing, you are raising the barrier to entry.  And when you do this, you are talking down to a person and making them feel small, stupid and all the other power trips that go with sexism. And yes, those thing are still there even if you <em>"didn’t mean to do it"</em>.
</p>
<p>
     So let ‘s make sure and keep API examples about solving problems and putting the valuable API resources to use, and not about gender, and get EVERYONE on board.
</p>
<p>
     End of story! And if ever step over this line, call me out. I welcome it, cause I'm not perfect or exempt.
