     As the usage of domestic, commercial usage of drones expands in the United States, the drone manufacturing industry in partnership with the federal government is looking for ways to improve their technology.
</p>
<p>
     We are seeing a new pilot program emerge in the remote outback of Colorado in the small town of Deer Trail. Fueled by a single government operative the small town has put a proposal up for vote, calling to issue drone hunting license in the state.
</p>
<p>
     Seizing the moment, the federal government has welcome the opportunity, calling on several leading manufacturers to push drone technology further, through a series of controlled tests in the State of Colorado.
</p>
<p>
     Under the cover of agricultural, mineral, forestry and real estate operations, government contractors will be testing out the latest drone technologies in hopes of taking fire. While there has been plenty of opportunities in Afghanistan and Pakistan for collection of data, there are non domestic patterns available, regarding how locals will return fire or outright hunt drone technology.
</p>
<p>
     According to sources there are up to 30 other locations across the country where similar pilot programs will take place. The US government is looking forward to gathering the data, and better understand what is possible when it comes to the potential of local drone hunters.
