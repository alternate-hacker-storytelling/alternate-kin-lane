<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In August 2006, shortly after <a title="Amazon S3 Launch" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/12/history-of-apis-amazon-s3/">Amazon launched its new cloud storage service Amazon S3</a>, the company followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed <a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/">Amazon EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud</a>.
<p></p><a title="Amazon EC2" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, by allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers.
<p></p>Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.
<p></p>Using the Amazon EC2 API developers can launch small, large and extra large servers and pay for every hour that the server is running.
<p></p>Amazon EC2, combined with Amazon S3 has provided the platform for the next generation of computing with APIs at the core.
