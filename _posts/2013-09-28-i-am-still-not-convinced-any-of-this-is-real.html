<p>The more I progress through life, I'm increasingly convinced that none of this is real.  As soon as I left the small town I was raised in, I began seeing signs that this was all just a video game extension of the small town arcade I used to blow all my quarters in at the other end of town.</p>

<p>I got a taste of virtual reality, programming computers in the 80's, even before the Internet was widely available--giving me some awareness that this was truly a reality show version of the game of civilization.</p>

<p>While I hit many speed bumps through out my early years I quickly learned i could manifest what I needed, albeit sometimes this was a good ass kicking and night spent sleeping in a ditch.  The powers of manifestation isn't something they teach you in school, it is something you have to be introduced to incrementally through loving instruction and simultaneous pain, suffering and torture.</p>

<p>After learning I could apply Jedi mind tricks on individuals ranging from criminals to law enforcement I quickly realized I need to exercise my skills in a much more safer environment before I pushed things too far, and possibly exploded in a ball of flames.</p>

<p>After several years of working out in a friendly, small town work environment I thought my financial reality was a good place to test out my skills. Starting at about 30K annual income I wanted to see what I could expand this to in a mater of 5 years, ultimately taking things to 150K before I knew that I had what it would take to go the distance, but money wasn't what interested me.</p>

<p>Next I wanted to see if I could expand on the scope of the the world in which I was exposed to on a geographical. I wanted to be able to command things at not just a national level, but take it global and see what I could make happen. This obviously would take flexing the financial side of things, but also would take reaching a new scope of the characters I interacted with, requiring time, patience and good ol fashion relationship building.</p>

<p>This is where I stand. I'm able to rise to a national level, getting the attention of national leaders in government and corporations. I've successfully attracted global forces in technology and across multiple other business sectors., and now its just a matter of understanding what I can do next.</p>

<p>Pushing the boundaries of reality have shown me that none of this is real. It is al just a matter of understanding the appropriate game mechanics and physics at play in this reality and understand which level I'm currently on.</p>

<p>Let's see what I can manifest next, and where we can take all of this.</p>
