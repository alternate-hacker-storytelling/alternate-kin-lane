<p>Standing in the grocery store line, the young man in front of me was purchasing alcohol, and the cashier kindly asked him for his ID. He jokingly said I don&rsquo;t look over 36? She laughed, and she said no, and &ldquo;the cameras are watching&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She explained that when the point of sale system scans alcohol it takes a series of still photos. Even though it is a video camera taking video all the time, not all video is kept, after a period of time video is overwritten, however the still photos associated with transactions are kept forever.</p>
<p>We know every time you&rsquo;ve bought alcohol, and have a picture of you doing it. I&rsquo;ve seen the software in action, and it can scan all the alcohol purchases for a day, and return the ones where ID wasn&rsquo;t asked for. So I have to always ask for ID, otherwise I get in trouble.</p>
