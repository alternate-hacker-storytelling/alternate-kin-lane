     Standing in the grocery store line, the young man in front of me was purchasing alcohol, and the cashier kindly asked him for his ID. He jokingly said I don’t look over 36? She laughed, and she said no, and “the cameras are watching”.

     She explained that when the point of sale system scans alcohol it takes a series of still photos. Even though it is a video camera taking video all the time, not all video is kept, after a period of time video is overwritten, however the still photos associated with transactions are kept forever.

     We know every time you’ve bought alcohol, and have a picture of you doing it. I’ve seen the software in action, and it can scan all the alcohol purchases for a day, and return the ones where ID wasn’t asked for. So I have to always ask for ID, otherwise I get in trouble.
